    "inferred_stereotype": "role",
    "explanation": "A nonmaleficense requirement is an anti-rigid specialization of kinds, representing a necessary condition for the instances of a kind. In this case, it represents a role that something must play in order to be considered nonmaleficent."

Note: I've inferred the stereotypes based on the descriptions provided, which seem to fit best with the OntoUML stereotypes. If there are any inconsistencies or misunderstandings, please let me know and I'll be happy to adjust accordingly!
