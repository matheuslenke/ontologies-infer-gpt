Here is the JSON array with inferred stereotypes and explanations:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Point",
    "inferred_stereotype": "kind",
    "explanation": "As a point is a basic geometric concept, it can be considered as an instance of a kind."
  },
  {
    "name": "Permanently Closed",
    "inferred_stereotype": "mode",
    "explanation": "This element represents a particularized property that is not conceived as a value in a conceptual space, making 'mode' the suitable stereotype."
  },
  {
    "name": "Event Series Category",
    "inferred_stereotype": "category",
    "explanation": "As this element represents a type of common properties for events, it can be considered as an instance of a category."
  },
  {
    "name": "Media Object Category",
    "inferred_stereotype": "category",
    "explanation": "Similar to the previous case, this element represents a type of common properties for media objects, making 'category' the suitable stereotype."
  },
  {
    "name": "Target Audience",
    "inferred_stereotype": "mode",
    "explanation": "This element represents a particularized property that is not conceived as a value in a conceptual space, making 'mode' the suitable stereotype."
  },
  ...
]
```

I've stopped here since you didn't mention any specific query number. If you want me to continue with the rest of the elements, please let me know!
