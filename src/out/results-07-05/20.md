    "name": "Element",
    "inferred_stereotype": "kind",
    "explanation": "As the name suggests, an 'element' is a fundamental concept or unit of something. It can be considered as a kind of thing that has its own unique properties and characteristics."
  },

    "name": "Var_Reg",
    "inferred_stereotype": "role",
    "explanation": "A variable regulation seems to imply some sort of dynamic relationship between different elements. This suggests the concept of a role, where an individual or entity plays a specific part in a larger system."
  },
  {
    "name": "Element_Module",
    "inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
    "explanation": "An 'element module' can be seen as a specialized or refined version of an element. This would fit with the stereotype of a subkind, which is a rigid specialization of a kind."
  },
  {
    "name": "Deg_Reg",
    "inferred_stereotype": "mode",
    "explanation": "A degree regulation seems to describe a specific way in which something is regulated or managed. This can be seen as a mode, which is an instance of a class stereotyped mode that is not conceived as a value in a conceptual space."

    "name": "Subject",
    "inferred_stereotype": "kind",
    "explanation": "The term 'subject' implies some sort of entity or thing that is being studied or considered. This would fit with the stereotype of a kind, which is a fundamental concept or unit of something."

    "name": "Module_Phase",
    "inferred_stereotype": "phase",
    "explanation": "A module phase suggests some sort of developmental or evolutionary process that an entity undergoes. This would fit with the stereotype of a phase, which represents changes in intrinsic properties of instances of a kind."

    "name": "Variant",
    "inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
    "explanation": "A variant can be seen as a specialized or refined version of something else. This would fit with the stereotype of a subkind, which is a rigid specialization of a kind."

    "name": "Regulation",
    "inferred_stereotype": "relator",
    "explanation": "Regulation implies some sort of governing or controlling process that affects other entities. This can be seen as a relator, which is an instance of a class stereotyped relator that is a truth-maker of a material relation."
  },
  {
    "name": "Degree",
    "inferred_stereotype": "mode",
    "explanation": "A degree seems to describe some sort of measure or extent in which something is evaluated. This can be seen as a mode, which is an instance of a class stereotyped mode that is not conceived as a value in a conceptual space."

  {
    "name": "DegreeRegulation",
    "inferred_stereotype": "role",
    "explanation": "A degree regulation implies some sort of governing or controlling process that affects the extent to which something occurs. This would fit with the stereotype of a role, where an individual or entity plays a specific part in a larger system."

    "name": "PhaseWithModule",
    "inferred_stereotype": "phase",
    "explanation": "A phase with module suggests some sort of developmental or evolutionary process that involves different modules or components. This would fit with the stereotype of a phase, which represents changes in intrinsic properties of instances of a kind."

    "name": "Sub_Phase",
    "inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
    "explanation": "A sub-phase can be seen as a specialized or refined version of a phase. This would fit with the stereotype of a subkind, which is a rigid specialization of a kind."
