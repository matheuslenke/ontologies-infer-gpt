Based on the provided OntoUML stereotypes and semantics, I will infer a possible stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype. Here is the output in CSV format:

```
name;inferred_stereotype;explanation
Employee;mode;An instance of a class stereotyped mode is a particularized property that is not conceived as a value in a conceptual space.
Organizational Customer;relator;A relator is an entity that needs to exist for two or more related individuals to be connected through a material relation.
Allocation;mode;An instance of a class stereotyped mode is a particularized property that is not conceived as a value in a conceptual space.
Person;kind;The most general stereotype, representing a concept or category that can have instances with unique identities.
Budget;quantity;A quantity is an instance of a class stereotyped quantity that represents a countable or measurable entity.
Construction Work;mode;An instance of a class stereotyped mode is a particularized property that is not conceived as a value in a conceptual space.
Stage;phase;Phases are sortals whose contingent classification conditions are intrinsic, representing changes in intrinsic properties of instances of a kind.
Subtstage;subkind;Subkinds are rigid specializations of a kind, for example, we can have Man as a subkind of Person.
Photo;quality;A quality is an instance of a class stereotyped quality that represents a characteristic or attribute that can be measured or described.
Personal Customer;mode;An instance of a class stereotyped mode is a particularized property that is not conceived as a value in a conceptual space.
Agent;role;Roles are sortals whose contingent classification conditions are relational, representing changes in intrinsic properties of instances of a kind.
Organization;kind;The most general stereotype, representing a concept or category that can have instances with unique identities.
Customer;mode;An instance of a class stereotyped mode is a particularized property that is not conceived as a value in a conceptual space.

Please note that the inferred stereotypes are based on my understanding of OntoUML semantics and may require further refinement or adjustment according to specific domain knowledge.
