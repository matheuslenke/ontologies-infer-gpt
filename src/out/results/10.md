To process the user query, I will follow the steps outlined in the system. The user query is a list of element names, which are:

Winery visit, user, sport activity, Hiking, Adress, payment, plan, point, int, in progres, museum visit, itinerary, castel visit, church visit, geometry, Skiing, activity certificate, time, cultural visit, language certificate, Climbing, resturant visit, activity, location, city center visit, Tourist Guide, receipt, completed, Cycling, certification, offer, finish, string, paid, tourist, online payment, float, planed, Multi Line String, path, Point, feedback, food and wine tour, being processed, Multi_ point, long, credit/ debit card payment, booking, Line String

Here are the results:
