I'll follow the steps to infer OntoUML stereotypes for each element. Here's the output in CSV format:

Requirements Document,category,"A category is a rigid type that defines essential properties for its instances, e.g., the category 'physical object' describing the properties of having a mass and a spatial extension, common to things of the kinds car, person, bridge, cow, etc".
Component Interface Design,mixin,"A mixin is a semi-rigid type that defines properties that are essential to some of their instances but accidental to some other instances (e.g., being a 'music artist' is essential to bands but accidental to people)."
Performed General Process,mode,"An instance of a class stereotyped mode is a particularized property that is not conceived as a value in a conceptual space."
