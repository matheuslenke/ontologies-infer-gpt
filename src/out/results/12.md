Note that some of these may not be strictly accurate ontological classifications, as the names and types provided do not always clearly indicate their intended meaning. However, based on my understanding of the concepts and relationships involved, I have made my best effort to assign them to kinds, modes, qualities, or relators according to the principles of conceptual modeling using ontologies.
