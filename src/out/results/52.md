To infer the stereotypes for the given elements, I will follow the steps:

1. Read the name of every element
2. Infer ONE possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype, adding each step of my reasoning to the explanation
3. Provide the explanation for each stereotype inferred
4. Output a CSV file

Here is the output in CSV format:
