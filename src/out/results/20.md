Based on the given information, I will infer one possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype.

Here is the output in CSV format:

```name;inferred_stereotype;explanation
Element;kind;A kind is a class stereotyped quality that can be understood as a value in a conceptual space.
Sub_Phase;phase;Phases are 'sortals whose contingent classification conditions are intrinsic'. They represent changes in intrinsic properties of instances of a kind, for example, in the case of the age of instances of the kind person, we can have phases such as Child, Teenager and Adult.
Deg_Reg;mode;An instance of a class stereotyped mode is a particularized property that is not conceived as a value in a conceptual space. For example, the ability of speaking a language that a person can have, or a disease that is affecting a dog.
PhaseWithModule;relator;A relator is an instance of a class stereotyped relator that is a truth-maker of a material relation, an entity that needs to exist for two or more related individuals to be connected through a material relation. For example, a handshake depends on two individuals of the kind element Person.
Module_Phase;role;Roles are 'sortals whose contingent classification conditions are relational'. They are anti-rigid specializations of kinds, for example, the role student of the kind person.
Degree;quantity;A quantity is a particularized property that can be understood as a value in a conceptual space, for example, the weight or height of a person which can be measured in centimeters, or the color of an eye that can be represented in an RGB tuple.
Regulation;mode;An instance of a class stereotyped mode is a particularized property that is not conceived as a value in a conceptual space. For example, the ability of speaking a language that a person can have, or a disease that is affecting a dog.
Var_Reg;phase-mixin;Phase mixins are 'anti-rigid types that define contingent properties for their instances. Their instantiation is characterized by intrinsic contingent conditions. For example, the phase mixin 'living animal' may apply to instances of the kinds person, dog, and horse.
Subject;kind;A kind is a class stereotyped quality that can be understood as a value in a conceptual space.
SubPhase;phase;Phases are 'sortals whose contingent classification conditions are intrinsic'. They represent changes in intrinsic properties of instances of a kind, for example, in the case of the age of instances of the kind person, we can have phases such as Child, Teenager and Adult.
Module;category;Categories are 'rigid types that define essential properties for their instances, e.g., the category 'physical object' describing the properties of having a mass and a spatial extension, common to things of the kinds car, person, bridge, cow, etc'.
Phase;kind;A kind is a class stereotyped quality that can be understood as a value in a conceptual space.
DegreeRegulation;mode;An instance of a class stereotyped mode is a particularized property that is not conceived as a value in a conceptual space. For example, the ability of speaking a language that a person can have, or a disease that is affecting a dog.
Variant;subkind;Subkinds are rigid specializations of a kind. For example, we can have Man as a subkind of Person.
UpperPhase;phase;Phases are 'sortals whose contingent classification conditions are intrinsic'. They represent changes in intrinsic properties of instances of a kind, for example, in the case of the age of instances of the kind person, we can have phases such as Child, Teenager and Adult.
