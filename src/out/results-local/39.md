Based on the provided ontology, I will summarize it as follows:

- The ontology defines different types of entities, including kinds, collectives, quantities, qualities, modes, and relators.
- Kinds are rigid categories that define essential properties for their instances. Examples include Person and Car.
- Collectives are groups of individuals of a kind. For example, Family is a collective of people.
- Quantities are measures or amounts of something. For instance, the weight of an object.
- Qualities are characteristics or attributes of an entity. For example, a person's height or color.
- Modes are particularized properties that are not conceived as values in a conceptual space. Examples include speaking a language or having a disease.
- Relators are truth-makers of material relations, entities that need to exist for two or more related individuals to be connected through a material relation. For instance, marriage is a relator between two people.

Additionally, the ontology introduces subkind, phase, and role as sortal stereotypes that represent their counterparts in UFO.

Subkinds are rigid specializations of a kind. Examples include Man being a subkind of Person.
Phases are 'sortals whose contingent classification conditions are intrinsic'. For instance, Child is a phase of the kind person, representing changes in intrinsic properties.
Roles are anti-rigid specializations of kinds, for example, student being a role of the kind person.

Non-sortals are types that represent common properties of individuals of multiple Kinds. Examples include category, phase-mixin, role-mixin, and mixin.

- Category is a rigid type that defines essential properties for its instances.
- Phase-mixin is an anti-rigid type that defines contingent properties for its instances.
- Role-mixin is a semi-rigid type that defines properties that are essential to some of their instances but accidental to some other instances.
- Mixture is a semi-rigid type that defines properties that are essential to some of their instances but accidental to some other instances.

Now, I will infer one possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype:
