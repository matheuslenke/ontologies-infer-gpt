I will follow the steps provided to answer the user query.

**Step 1: Read the name of every element**

The elements are:
```
Normative Act
Article
Letter Discriminator
Article composed of Item
Chapter composed by Article
Preamble
Subsection

Paragraph
Chapter composed by Section
Item component of Article
Composed Article

General Part
Special Part
Multiple Part
Simple Letter
int
Article composed of Paragraph

```

**Step 2: Explain the ontology in summary**

The provided ontology is based on OntoUML, which uses stereotypes to categorize concepts into different types. The main categories are sortals (kinds, collectives, quantities, qualities, modes, and relators) and non-sortals (categories, phase-mixins, role-mixins, and mixins). Sortals represent specific types of things, while non-sortals represent common properties or characteristics that can apply to multiple sorts.

**Step 3: Infer ONE possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype**

After analyzing the elements, I will infer one possible OntoUML stereotype for each element:

```

Component Section;subkind
Section;kind

Article component of Chapter;relator
```

**Step 4: Output a CSV file**
