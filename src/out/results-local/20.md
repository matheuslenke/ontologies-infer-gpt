Based on the provided ontology, I will infer one possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype.

Here is the summary of the ontology:

* A class stereotyped quality is a particularized property that can be understood as a value in a conceptual space.
* A mode is an instance of a class stereotyped mode and represents a particularized property that is not conceived as a value in a conceptual space.
* A relator is an instance of a class stereotyped relator and represents a truth-maker of a material relation.

The possible stereotypes for classes are: kind, collective, quantity, quality, mode, relator, subkind, phase, role, historicalRole, historicalRoleMixin, category, phaseMixin, roleMixin, mixin, type, event, situation, process.

Here is the inferred stereotype for each element:

```
Variant;quality
Deg_Reg;mode
Subject;role
Module_Phase;phase

Sub_Phase;phase

Var_Reg;mode
SubPhase;phase

Element;element

```

Please note that these are just possible stereotypes and may not be the only correct classification for each element.
