System:  I understand the task at hand. Here is a summary of the ontology:

The ontology consists of different types of classes and relations. Classes can be categorized into six main types: kind, collective, quantity, quality, mode, and relator. These classes have instances that have particularized properties, such as weight or height for a person.

Sortals are rigid specializations of kinds, and the additional sortal stereotypes subkind, phase, and role represent their counterparts in UFO. Non-sortals are types that represent common properties of individuals of multiple Kinds, and these include categories, phase-mixins, role-mixins, and mixins.

Relations can be categorized into various types, including material, derivation, comparative, mediation, characterization, external dependence, component of, member of, sub-collection of, sub-quantity of, instantiation, termination, participational, participation, historical dependence, creation, manifestation, brings about, triggers, composition, aggregation, inherence, value, and formal.

Now that I have summarized the ontology, I will proceed to infer one possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype:

```

I hope this output meets your requirements.
