Active Sk SN-FEP - Sk CFTE connected: Active System connected to System Network Function and Common Forwarding Table Entry
Bidirectional M-FP: Bidirectional Management Plane Functional Plane
Bidirectional Adaptation - Bi A Connected: Bidirectional Adaptation connected to System
Sink SN-FEP Binding: Sink Subnetwork Function Entity Point Binding
Layer Processor Function Sink: Layer Processor Function Sink
Active Sk PM-FEP - PM LC connected: Active System connected to Physical Media and Link Connection
Forwarding Point: Forwarding Point
Sink SN-FEP Bi Component: Sink Subnetwork Function Entity Point Bi Component
Active Sk M-FP - Int MC connected: Active System connected to Management Plane Functional Plane and Intermediate Management Plane
Mapped TF Output: Mapped Transport Function Output
Sink MC Bi Component: Sink Management Plane Bi Component
Active Path Bidirectional M-FP: Active Path Bidirectional Management Plane Functional Plane

Please note that I will only respond based on the provided rules and not provide any external information or answers.
