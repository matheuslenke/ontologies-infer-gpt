Here is the summary of the Ontology:

The ontology defines different sorts of classes and relations. Classes can be categorized into sortals (kind, subkind, phase, role) which are rigid specializations of a kind, or non-sortals (category, phase-mixin, role-mixin, mixin) which define common properties of individuals of multiple kinds.

Relations can be material, derivation, comparative, mediation, characterization, external dependence, component-of, member-of, sub-collection-of, sub-quantity-of, instantiation, termination, participational, participation, historical dependence, creation, manifestation, brings-about, triggers, composition, aggregation, inherence, value, or formal.

Now, let's infer a possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype:

Note that some elements have no clear OntoUML stereotype and are marked as 'n/a' or the corresponding stereotype is not well-defined in this ontology.
