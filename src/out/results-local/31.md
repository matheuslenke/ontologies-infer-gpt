I'll follow the steps to answer your user queries. Here's a summary of the ontology:

The ontology consists of various stereotypes for classes and relations. For classes, there are sortals (kind, collective, quantity, quality, mode, relator) and non-sortals (subkind, phase, role, category, phase-mixin, role-mixin, mixin). Sortals represent intrinsic properties of instances, while non-sortals represent common properties among different kinds.

Now, let's infer one possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype:
