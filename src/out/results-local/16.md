To infer the stereotypes for each element, I will summarize the ontology and then apply it to each element.

Summary:
The ontology consists of several types: sortals (kinds, modes, relators) and non-sortals (categories, phase-mixins, role-mixins). Sortals represent specific types or classes of things. Non-sortals represent common properties or characteristics shared by multiple sorts. The key differences are that sortals are rigid specializations of a kind, while non-sortals are more flexible and can be applied to different sorts.

Now, let's infer the stereotypes for each element:

1. Regular Clergy - kind
2. Witness of Profession - mode
3. Clergyman - role
4. Person - kind
5. Pope - role
6. Nomination - relator
7. Electorate of the Cadinal School - category
8. College of Cardinals - collective
9. Secular Clergy Member - role
10. Regular Clergy Member - role
11. Clergy - collective
12. Layman - mode
13. Bishop - kind
14. Ordination - relator
15. Religious Profession - event
16. Ordinator of Deacon - role
17. Ordained Bishop - process
18. Cardinal Nominator - role
19. Secular Clergy - category
20. Ordinator of Priest - role
21. Cardinal - kind
22. Deacon - mode
23. Clergy Member - role
24. Election - event
25. Ordination of Priest - process
26. Priest - kind
27. Ordination of Deacon - process
28. Ordinator of Bishop - role
29. Baptism - event

Here is the output in CSV format:
