System: 

The provided text describes the OntoUML ontology and its stereotypes for classes and relations.

Summary:
- In OntoUML, a class stereotyped quality is a particularized property that can be understood as a value in a conceptual space.
- An instance of a class stereotyped mode is not conceived as a value in a conceptual space.
- A relator is an entity that needs to exist for two or more related individuals to be connected through a material relation.
- Sortal stereotypes include subkind, phase, and role, which represent rigid specializations, changes in intrinsic properties, and relational contingent classification conditions, respectively.
- Non-sortals are types that represent common properties of individuals from multiple kinds.
