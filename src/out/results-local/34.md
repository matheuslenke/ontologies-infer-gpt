Based on the given ontology and stereotypes, I will infer a possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype.

**Summary of the Ontology**

The ontology is based on the Conceptual Modeling framework. It defines various stereotypes for classes (kind, collective, quantity, quality, mode, relator, subkind, phase, role) and relations (material, derivation, comparative, mediation, characterization, external dependence, component of, member of, subcollection of, subquantity of, instantiation, termination, participational, participation, historical dependence, creation, manifestation, brings about, triggers, composition, aggregation, inherence, value, formal). The ontology also distinguishes between sortals (kind, phase, role) and non-sortals (category, phase-mixin, role-mixin, mixin).

**Inferred Stereotypes**

1. Beneficence Requirement; kind
2. Autonomy Requirement; mode
3. Ethical Requirement; quality
4. Nonmaleficence Intention; relator
5. UFO:Quality Value; quality
6. UFO:Agent; role
7. Intention; mode
8. UFO: Quality Region; quality
9. Explicability Requirement; mode
10. NFR:Quality Requirement; quality
11. UFOC:Goal; role
12. UFO:Quality; quality
13. UFOC:Goal; role
14. Nonmaleficense Requirement; relator
15. Justice Requirement; kind
16. NFR:Requirement; mode
17. COVER:Loss Event; event
18. Nonmaleficence Requirement; mode
19. Beneficence Intention; mode
20. Beneficence Requirement; quality
21. UFO:Quality Universal; quality
22. NFR:Quality Requirement; quality
23. COVER:Gain Event; event
24. NFR:Requirement; mode
