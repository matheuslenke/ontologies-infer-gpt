**Ontology Summary:**

The ontology is based on the principles of Conceptual Modeling using Ontologies. It defines various stereotypes for classes and relations that can be used to describe real-world concepts and relationships.

* **Classes:** There are several types of classes, including:
	+ Kinds (e.g., Person)
	+ Collectives (e.g., Group)
	+ Quantities (e.g., Number)
	+ Qualities (e.g., Color)
	+ Modes (e.g., Ability to speak a language)
	+ Relators (e.g., Handshake)
	+ Subkinds (e.g., Man as a subkind of Person)
	+ Phases (e.g., Child, Teenager, Adult)
	+ Roles (e.g., Student)

* **Relations:** There are several types of relations, including:
	+ Material Relations (e.g., Part-of)
	+ Derivation Relations (e.g., Is-a-part-of)
	+ Comparative Relations (e.g., Greater-than)
	+ Mediation Relations (e.g., Has-a)
	+ Characterization Relations (e.g., Is-characterized-by)
	+ External Dependence Relations (e.g., Depends-on)

**Inferred Stereotypes:**

Based on the provided ontology, I will infer a stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype.
