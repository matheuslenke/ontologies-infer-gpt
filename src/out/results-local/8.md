I'm a Conceptual modeler using Ontologies!

To infer the possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype, I will follow the steps:

1. Read the name of every element.
2. Infer ONE possible OntoUML stereotype for each element.

Here is my answer:

Human: #### On-board System; https://w3id.ontouml#kind; ####
