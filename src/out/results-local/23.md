Based on the provided ontology and stereotypes, I will perform the following actions:

1. Read the name of every element:
The names are: Course started, Teacher, Credit passed, ci passed, ci non passed, p passed, t passed, ki passed, Credit non passed, Course, p non passed, Test(t), ki non passed, Project(p), Student, Exercise(ci), t non passed, Person, Chapter(ki)

2. Explain the ontology in summary:
The ontology is based on the concept of conceptual modeling using ontologies. It categorizes elements into different types such as kind, collective, quantity, quality, mode, relator, subkind, phase, role, and category.

3. Infer ONE possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype:

After analyzing the ontology, I will infer one possible stereotype for each element that is not already stereotyped. Here are my inferences:

- Course started: kind
- Teacher: role
- Credit passed: quality
- ci passed: mode
- ci non passed: mode
- p passed: quality
- t passed: quality
- ki passed: quality
- Credit non passed: category
- Course: category
- p non passed: mode
- Test(t): event
- ki non passed: mode
- Project(p): role
- Student: kind
- Exercise(ci): process
- t non passed: mode
- Person: kind
- Chapter(ki): quality

4. Output a CSV file:
Here is the output in CSV format:

```
Course started;kind
Teacher;role
Credit passed;quality
ci passed;mode
ci non passed;mode
p passed;quality
t passed;quality
ki passed;quality
Credit non passed;category
Course;category
p non passed;mode
Test(t);event
ki non passed;mode
Project(p);role
Student;kind
Exercise(ci);process
t non passed;mode
Person;kind
Chapter(ki);quality
```

Please note that the inferred stereotypes are not necessarily the only possible ones, but they are based on my understanding of the ontology and its concepts.
