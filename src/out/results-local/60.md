Based on the provided ontology, I will summarize it and then infer possible OntoUML stereotypes for each element.

Summary:
The ontology includes various concepts such as classes (kinds, collectives, quantities, qualities, modes, relators), subkind, phase, role, categories, phase mixins, role mixins, and non-sortal types. It also defines relations between these concepts. The main idea is that instances of a class can have different properties that make them unique, such as being a person or an object.

Inferring stereotypes:
Based on the provided list of element names, I will infer possible OntoUML stereotypes for each element with a missing stereotype:

```

Note that some of these inferences might not be the most accurate, as the provided ontology is quite general and doesn't provide much context.
