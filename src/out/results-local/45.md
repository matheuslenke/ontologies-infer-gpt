Based on the provided ontology summary and stereotype definitions, I will infer a possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype.

Here is the output in CSV format:
```
DeclaredValue;quality
Payment;mode
Sale;relator
ConsumerNeed;mode
Purchase;mode
RawProduct;quantity
Policy;mode
Receipt;mode
Actor;kind
Consumer;role
Production;mode
ValueActivity;mode
Provider;role
GeographicIndication;quality
ProvenanceEvaluation;mode
DeclaredProvenance;mode
ValueObject;quality
CounterObject;quantity
Provenance;phase
EndProduct;quality
BusinessNeed;mode
Agent;kind
```
Please note that the inferred stereotypes are based on my understanding of the ontology and may not be the only possible classification.
