**Summary of the Ontology**

The ontology describes different types of entities and relationships. It includes sortals (kinds, collectives, quantities, qualities, modes, relators) that represent specific concepts or categories. These sortals can be further specialized into subkinds, phases, and roles. Non-sortals, such as categories, phase-mixins, role-mixins, and mixins, represent common properties of individuals from multiple kinds.
