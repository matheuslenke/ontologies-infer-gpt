I will follow the instructions and provide a CSV file with the inferred stereotypes for each element. Here is the summary of the ontology:

The ontology defines several sortal stereotypes (kind, mode, relator) that represent different types of entities or relations. The additional sortal stereotypes subkind, phase, and role specialize a unique kind from which they inherit a principle of identity for their instances. The non-sortals category, phase-mixin, role-mixin, and mixin are types that represent common properties of individuals of multiple Kinds.

Now, I will infer one possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype:

```csv
PublicOrganization;category
Autarchy;role
StateCompany;category
PublicEntity;category
Órgão Colegiado;category
Company;category
UnityOfOrganization;category
MixedEconomyCompany;category
PublicAdmnistrativeUnit;category
Foundation;category
Organization;category
PublicCompany;category
NonEmpresarialPublicEntity;category
OrganizationalUnit;category
Órgão;category
```

Please note that the inferred stereotypes are based on my understanding of the ontology and may not be the only possible interpretation.
