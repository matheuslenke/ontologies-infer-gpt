**Summary of Ontology:**

The ontology defines different types of classes and relations. Classes are categorized into six main sorts: kind, collective, quantity, quality, mode, and relator. Subkind, phase, and role represent specific kinds within the category of kind. Non-sortals include categories, phase-mixins, and mixins.
