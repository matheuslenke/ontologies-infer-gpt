Based on the ontology provided, I will summarize it and then infer one possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype.

**Ontology Summary:**

The ontology consists of sortal stereotypes (kind, mode, relator) and non-sortal stereotypes (category, phase-mixin, role-mixin, mixin). Sortals represent essential properties or changes in intrinsic properties of instances, while non-sorts represent common properties of individuals from multiple kinds.

**Inferred Stereotypes:**

Here is the list with inferred stereotypes:

```
Deliverable;mode
Software Project;kind
Performed Activity;mode
Stakeholder;role
Scheduled Process;relator
Specific Intended Process;mode
Scheduled Activity;relator
Cost Estimated Activity;quality
Performed Project Process;mode
Stakeholder Participation;relator
Tracked Stakeholder Participation;mode
Estimated Process;quantity
Practical Result;quality
General Intended Process;mode
Tracked Process;relator
Project Activity;kind
Specific Project Process;subkind
Intended Process;mode
Scope Estimated Activity;quality
Intended Activity;mode
Project Process;relator
Cost Estimated Process;quality
Estimated Stakeholder Allocation;quantity
Duration Estimated Process;quantity
Performed Specific Process;mode
Duration Estimated Activity;quantity
Estimated Activity;quantity
General Project Process;kind
Performed Process;mode
Work Package;subkind
Performed General Process;mode
Stakeholder Allocation;relator
Performed Project Activity;mode
Tracked Activity;relator
```

Please note that these inferred stereotypes are based on my understanding of the ontology and may not be the only possible stereotype for each element.
