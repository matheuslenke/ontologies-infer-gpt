I will follow the steps to answer the user queries.

**Step 1: Read the name of every element**

The elements are:
```
Podcast, Offer, Course, Viewable, Private Interaction, Popular Selection, Labor Record, Education Record, Link, Subject, IP Visitor, NACE Section, Component, Anonymous Visitor, Follow, NACE Class, Selected Activity, Popular Skill, Followable, Skill, View, Organization, Company, Upvote, Feed, NACE Group, Occupation, Corporate User, Resource, Comment, Selection, Delete, NACE Division, Upvotable, Skill Popularity, Book, Learning Manager, Collection, Country, Public Interaction, Creatable, Cookie consent, Comment0, Record, Tag, Popular Occupation, Occupation Popularity, Terms, Edit, Corporate Resource, Job Description, Learning Path, Commentable, Deletable, Interaction, Video, Economic Activity Classification NACE, Public Resource, Editable, Settings, Creation, Logged Visitor, User, Search, School
```

**Step 2: Explain the ontology in summary**

The ontology describes different types of entities and relationships. The main categories are:
* Sortals (kind, collective, quantity, quality, mode, relator): represent concrete objects or abstract concepts that have a principle of identity.
	+ Subkinds: rigid specializations of kinds.
	+ Phases: sortals whose contingent classification conditions are intrinsic.
	+ Roles: sortals whose contingent classification conditions are relational.
* Non-sortals (category, phase-mixin, role-mixin, mixin): represent common properties of individuals from multiple Kinds.

**Step 3: Infer ONE possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype**

After analyzing the elements, I inferred the following stereotypes:

```

**Step 4: Output a CSV file**

Here is the output in CSV format:
