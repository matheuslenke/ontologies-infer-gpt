**Summary of Ontology**

The ontology consists of three main categories:

1. **Sortals**: These are types that represent individuals with intrinsic properties (kind, collective, quantity, quality, mode, relator). Subkinds and phases are rigid and anti-rigid specializations of kinds, respectively.
2. **Non-Sortals**: These are types that represent common properties of individuals from multiple Kinds (category, phase-mixin, role-mixin, mixin).
3. **Relations**: These are connections between entities with different semantic roles (material, derivation, comparative, mediation, characterization, etc.).

**Inferred Stereotypes**

Based on the given ontology and the user query, I will infer one possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype.

1. Organizational Customer; **category**: A category that describes essential properties of individuals related to an organization.
2. Subtstage; **phase**: A phase is a sortal whose contingent classification conditions are intrinsic.
3. Person; **kind**: A kind is a type that represents individuals with intrinsic properties.
4. Organization; **kind**: An organization is also a kind, representing an individual with intrinsic properties.
5. Allocation; **mode**: A mode is a particularized property that can be understood as a value in a conceptual space.
6. Stage; **phase**: A stage is a phase, a sortal whose contingent classification conditions are intrinsic.
7. Agent; **role**: An agent is an individual with a role, which represents a truth-maker of a material relation.
8. Construction Work; **mode**: Construction work is a mode, a particularized property that can be understood as a value in a conceptual space.
9. Employee; **role**: An employee is an individual with a role, representing a truth-maker of a material relation.
10. Budget; **quantity**: A budget is a quantity, which represents a measurement or countable aspect.
11. Customer; **category**: A customer is an individual belonging to the category "customer".
12. Personal Customer; **role**: A personal customer has a role, representing a truth-maker of a material relation.
13. Photo; **quality**: A photo is a quality, which represents a value or measurement in a conceptual space.
