Based on the provided ontology, I will summarize it and then infer a possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype.

**Summary of the Ontology:**

The ontology defines several stereotypes:

1. **Sortals**: These are types that represent instances with a specific identity principle.
	* Kinds (e.g., Person)
	* Collectives (e.g., Family)
	* Quantities (e.g., Height)
	* Qualities (e.g., Color)
	* Modes (e.g., Ability to speak)
	* Relators (e.g., Marriage)

2. **Sortal Stereotypes**:
	* Subkinds (e.g., Man as a subkind of Person)
	* Phases (e.g., Child, Teenager, Adult)
	* Roles (e.g., Student)

3. **Non-Sortals**: These are types that represent common properties of individuals from multiple Kinds.
	* Categories (e.g., Physical Object)
	* Phase-Mixins (e.g., Living Animal)
	* Role-Mixins (e.g., Music Artist)
	* Mixins (e.g., being a music artist)

**Inferred Stereotypes:**

Based on the provided ontology, I will infer a possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype.

Please note that the inferred stereotypes may not be the only possible solution, as the ontology does not provide specific guidelines for each element. The output is based on my understanding of the provided ontology and may require further refinement or adjustment depending on the specific context and requirements.
