Based on the provided ontology and stereotype categories, I will infer one possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype.

Here is the summary of the ontology:

The ontology consists of stereotyped classes (kind, collective, quantity, quality, mode, relator) and their subcategories (subkind, phase, role). Additionally, there are non-stereotyped categories (category, phase-mixin, role-mixin, mixin).

Here is the inferred stereotype for each element:

````

Please note that the inferred stereotype might not be the only possible one, and different ontological interpretations are possible.
