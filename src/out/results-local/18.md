**Summary of the Ontology:**

The ontology is based on the concepts of sortals (kinds, collectives, quantities, qualities, modes, and relators) and non-sortals (categories, phase-mixins, role-mixins, and mixins). Sortals are rigid specializations of a kind that represent changes in intrinsic properties or relational properties. Non-sortals are types that define common properties of individuals from multiple kinds.
