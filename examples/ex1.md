    "explanation": "The element 'Prey' is a role, which is a sortal whose contingent classification conditions are relational. It represents a specific role that an animal can have in relation to its predator."
  },
  {
    "name": "Ecosystem",

    "explanation": "The element 'Pollination' is a process, which represents a perdurant that unfolds in time. It represents the event of transferring pollen from the male part of a flower to the female part, enabling fertilization and reproduction."
  },
  {
    "name": "Food Chain",
    "infered_stereotype": "composition",
    "explanation": "The element 'Food Chain' is a composition, which represents a relation between two or more entities where the whole is composed of its parts. It represents the hierarchical relationship between different organisms in an ecosystem, where each organism serves as food for another organism."
  },
  {
    "name": "Predation",
    "infered_stereotype": "participation",
    "explanation": "The element 'Predation' is a participation, which represents a relation between two entities where one entity participates in a specific role in relation to the other entity.
