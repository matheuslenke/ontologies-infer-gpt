It looks like you have a list of terms, each associated with a general interpretation. To improve this list, you could consider providing more specific context for each term. For example, if "Writer" is often used to refer to authors specifically, that could be clarified. Additionally, adding examples or more detailed explanations for each term could help users understand their intended usage within the UFO and OntoUML ontology. Lastly, it might be helpful to categorize terms based on common characteristics such as being a person, object, action, or concept.
