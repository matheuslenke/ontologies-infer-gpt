    {
        "name": "Value Bearer",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Agent",
        "explanation": "In UFO, an Agent is a substantial endurant type that can perform actions and have beliefs. Value Bearer seems to represent an entity capable of bearing values, making it a suitable candidate for the 'Agent' stereotype."
    },
    {
        "name": "Rational Value Ascription (RVA)",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Relator",
        "explanation": "As RVA is involved in the relations between values and value bearers, it seems most suitable to infer it as a 'Relator'. In OntoUML, 'Relators' are truth-makers of material relations."
    },
    {
        "name": "Consequence",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Event",
        "explanation": "In UFO, events unfold in time and accumulate temporal parts, making them 'Perdurants'. Consequence seems to be an event that results from a prior event, suggesting it could be represented as an 'Event'."
    },
    {
        "name": "VA Component",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Quality",
        "explanation": "As VA Component is associated with the assignment of values, it can be inferred as a 'Quality'. In OntoUML, Qualities are particularized properties understood as values in a conceptual space."
    },
    {
        "name": "Value Component",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Quality",
        "explanation": "Similar reasoning to the previous element, Value Component also seems to be associated with values, suggesting it can be inferred as a 'Quality'."
    },
    {
        "name": "PVA Component",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Phase",
        "explanation": "In UFO, Phases are sortals with contingent intrinsic classification conditions. As PVA Component seems to represent a stage of development or change, it could be represented as a 'Phase'."
    },
    {
        "name": "RVA Component",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Role",
        "explanation": "Given that RVA Component seems to represent the role played by a value component, it can be inferred as a 'Role'. In OntoUML, 'Roles' are sortals with contingent relational classification conditions."
    },
    {
        "name": "Deprecated Bearer",
        "inferred_stereotype": "EndurantType",
        "explanation": "Though there isn't a specific stereotype for deprecated entities in OntoUML, EndurantType could be an appropriate choice as Deprecated Bearers are individual endurants."
    },
    {
        "name": "Loss Aversion",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Preference",
        "explanation": "As Loss Aversion is about the tendency to prefer avoiding losses rather than acquiring equivalent gains, it can be inferred as a 'Preference'."
    },
    {
        "name": "Action",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Event",
        "explanation": "Similar reasoning as for the 'Consequence' element. An action is an event that an agent performs."
    },
    {
        "name": "Preferred Bearer",
        "inferred_stereotype": "EndurantType",
        "explanation": "Though there isn't a specific stereotype for preferred entities in OntoUML, EndurantType could be an appropriate choice as Preferred Bearers are individual endurants."
    },
    {
        "name": "Mental Moment",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Cognitive Bias",
        "explanation": "In UFO, Cognitive Biases are intrinsic moments, making them suitable for representing Mental Moments. This can be an interesting case where the stereotype seems to overlap."
    },
    {
        "name": "Cognitive Bias",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Intuition",
        "explanation": "In UFO, Intuitions are psychologically based cognitive processes that produce an impression of knowledge or understanding, and can influence decision making. Cognitive Biases seem to fit this description, suggesting they could be represented as 'Intuitions'."
    },
    {
        "name": "Decision",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Event",
        "explanation": "Similar reasoning as for the 'Consequence' element. A decision is an event that an agent makes, usually after considering options and evaluating their potential outcomes."
    },
    {
        "name": "Agent",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Agent",
        "explanation": "Repeating the pattern of 'Agent' stereotypes for some elements is justified by the repeated association of these entities with value bearers and decision-making."
    },
    {
        "name": "Preference",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Quality",
        "explanation": "Similar reasoning as for some previous preference stereotypes. Preferences can be seen as qualities, particularly psychologically based ones."
    },
    {
        "name": "Choice",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Event",
        "explanation": "As a Choice represents the act of selecting one alternative from among two or more possibilities, it can be considered an 'Event'."
    },
    {
        "name": "Reference Point",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Value",
        "explanation": "In UFO, Values represent abstract ideas or ideals. As Reference Points are often used to measure the significance of something in relation to a standard, they can be represented as 'Values'."
    },
    {
        "name": "Psychological Preferred Bearer",
        "inferred_stereotype": "EndurantType",
        "explanation": "Similar reasoning as for the 'Preferred Bearer' element. Though there isn't a specific stereotype for preferred entities in OntoUML, EndurantType could be an appropriate choice as Preferred Bearers are individual endurants."
    },
    {
        "name": "Psychological Value Ascription (PVA)",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Relator",
        "explanation": "As PVA is involved in the relations between psychological values and value bearers, it seems most suitable to infer it as a 'Relator'. In OntoUML, Relators are truth-makers of material relations."
    },
    {
        "name": "Deliberation",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Event",
        "explanation": "Similar reasoning as for the 'Consequence' and 'Decision' elements. Deliberation can be seen as a series of thoughts, considerations or decisions taken before making a choice."
    },
    {
        "name": "Benefit",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Value",
        "explanation": "In UFO, Values represent abstract ideas or ideals. As Benefits are desired outcomes, they can be represented as 'Values'."
    },
    {
        "name": "Rational Value",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Value",
        "explanation": "As Rational Values are considered the objective, reasoned judgment of an Agent regarding the desirability of a particular outcome, they can be represented as 'Values'."
    },
    {
        "name": "ValueBeholder",
        "inferred_stereotype": "EndurantType",
        "explanation": "Though there isn't a specific stereotype for Value Bearers in OntoUML, EndurantType could be an appropriate choice as they are individual endurants."
    },
    {
        "name": "Loss Aversion",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Cognitive Bias",
        "explanation": "In UFO, Cognitive Biases are intrinsic moments, making them suitable for representing Mental Moments. This can be an interesting case where the stereotype seems to overlap."

You have successfully categorized all concepts into the appropriate ontology. The final step is to refine and expand upon each concept within their respective categories to provide more meaningful relationships between concepts and establish a stronger foundation for reasoning about the domain of human psychology and decision making, based on cognitive biases.
