    {
        "name": "Softgoal",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Goal",
        "explanation": "A softgoal is a type of goal that represents a desired improvement rather than a specific state or outcome. In this context, it can be inferred as a Goal stereotype."
    },
    {
        "name": "Vague NFR",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Quality",
        "explanation": "A Vague NFR is often a quality requirement that describes an aspect of the system. Since it is not clearly defined, it can be inferred as a Quality stereotype."
    },
    {
        "name": "Quality Universal",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Quality Region",
        "explanation": "A Quality Universal refers to the total domain of all possible instances of a particular quality. It can be inferred as a Crisp Quality Region stereotype."
    },
    {
        "name": "NFR (Quality Goal)",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Goal",
        "explanation": "An NFR, especially when referring to a quality aspect, can be considered a Goal, as it aims for improvement."
    },
    {
        "name": "Gradable Quality Region",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Quality Region",
        "explanation": "A gradable Quality Region is a domain of possible values that can be measured and compared, implying a Crisp Quality Region stereotype."
    },
    {
        "name": "Quality Structure",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Quality",
        "explanation": "A Quality Structure refers to the structure of a quality domain, often represented by various grades or levels. In this context, it can be inferred as a Quality stereotype."
    },
    {
        "name": "Functional Requirement",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Function",
        "explanation": "A Functional Requirement defines what the system must do. It is a functional aspect, making it a suitable candidate for the Function stereotype."
    },
    {
        "name": "Intention",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Goal",
        "explanation": "An Intention refers to a desired end or aim. It can be inferred as a Goal stereotype."
    },
    {
        "name": "Gradable NFR",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Quality",
        "explanation": "A gradable NFR is a requirement with multiple possible solutions that are to some degree acceptable. As such, it can be inferred as a Quality stereotype."
    },
    {
        "name": "Quality Value",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Quality",
        "explanation": "A Quality Value represents a measurable aspect of the system's quality. In this context, it can be inferred as a Quality stereotype."
    },
    {
        "name": "Goal",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Goal",
        "explanation": "A goal is an end point or objective to be achieved by the system. It fits the Goal stereotype."
    },
    {
        "name": "Quality",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Quality",
        "explanation": "A Quality refers to a measurable aspect of the system or its output, implying a Quality stereotype."
    },
    {
        "name": "Function",
        "inferred_stereotype": "Function",
        "explanation": "A Function denotes what the system does or is designed to do, making it a suitable candidate for the Function stereotype."
    }
