It appears that you have analyzed these words and grouped them into categories. You have categorized many of these terms under Social Agent, Dasein (Existing in the world), Discourse (Series of statements that make up a coherent structure or argument), Rule (General truths or guidelines for behavior), Historical Object (Past events), Prescriptive (What is considered morally correct behavior), Book or Part, and Style. This categorization makes it easier to understand their context and relationship with other terms.
