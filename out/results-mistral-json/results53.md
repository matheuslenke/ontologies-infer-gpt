    {
        "name": "Allelic Variant",
        "inferred_stereotype": "type",
        "explanation": "In UFO, a type is a rigid or non-rigid classification of individuals. Allelic variants are distinct entities and have their own properties."
    },
    {
        "name": "Record",
        "inferred_stereotype": "event",
        "explanation": "In UFO, events are perdurants that unfold in time. A record could be an event where information or data about something is registered."
    },
    {
        "name": "Alelle",
        "inferred_stereotype": "endurant",
        "explanation": "In UFO, endurants are individuals existing in time with all their parts. An allele can be thought of as an individual gene variant."
    },
    {
        "name": "Nucleotide",
        "inferred_stereotype": "quality",
        "explanation": "In UFO, qualities are particularized properties understood as a value in a conceptual space. Each nucleotide has specific values for its position."
    },
    {
        "name": "Inserted Nucleotide",
        "inferred_stereotype": "mode",
        "explanation": "In UFO, modes are particularized properties not conceived as a value in a conceptual space. An inserted nucleotide does not have a specific value, but rather represents a change or addition."
    },
    {
        "name": "Allelic Reference",
        "inferred_stereotype": "relator",
        "explanation": "In UFO, relators are truth-makers of material relations. An allelic reference could be a relator to another genetic element or variant."
    },
    {
        "name": "RefSeq",
        "inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
        "explanation": "In UFO, subkinds are rigid specializations of kinds. RefSeq is often a specific standard reference sequence for genes and variants."
    },
    {
        "name": "Gene",
        "inferred_stereotype": "endurant",
        "explanation": "In UFO, endurants are individuals existing in time with all their parts. A gene can be thought of as an individual genetic element."
    },
    {
        "name": "Insertion",
        "inferred_stereotype": "event",
        "explanation": "In UFO, events are perdurants that unfold in time. An insertion could be the event of a nucleotide being added."
    },
    {
        "name": "Chromosome",
        "inferred_stereotype": "endurant",
        "explanation": "In UFO, endurants are individuals existing in time with all their parts. A chromosome can be thought of as an individual genetic structure."
    }
