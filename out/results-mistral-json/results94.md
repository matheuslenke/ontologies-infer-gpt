Here's an explanation of each term:
1. Designer: An individual who creates or modifies designs in the software development process
2. Software Architect: Responsible for designing and overseeing the system's architecture.
3. Stakeholder: Any individual or organization who has an interest in the success or failure of the software project.
4. Design Documentation: Contains all design-related information about the software.
5. Design Document: Provides detailed information about the design aspects of a particular feature, interface, or component of the software.
6. Software Item: A piece of software that provides functionality to its users, including executable files and scripts.
7. Model: An abstract representation of a system or its components.
8. Data Model: Defines the structure, properties, and relationships of the data within the system.
9. Interface: Refers to the points where two different systems exchange information. In the context of software, interfaces are often user-facing elements such as buttons, menus, or input fields.
10. User Interface (UI): The part of the software that users interact with directly. This includes screens, layouts, visual effects, and other interactive elements.
11. Architectural Connector: Represents the interconnection between different architectural elements in the system.
12. Architectural Component: Represents a part of the software architecture, such as a service or module.
13. Process: A series of actions or steps that are performed to achieve a goal in the context of software development.
14. Activity: A single step or action within a larger process.
15. Interface High-level Design (IHLD): Provides a high-level overview of user interfaces within the system.
16. Simple Artifact: A basic piece of information or data produced during the software development process, such as a file or configuration setting.
