Based on the information provided, it seems that we have descriptions for various geological features (rocks, formations, structures), properties of hydrocarbons, and roles/functions within these systems. To analyze these data points using OWL (Web Ontology Language), I suggest creating classes to represent each unique concept, and then create relationships between classes to indicate the attributes or roles they have within the context provided.

For example:
1. Create a class "GeologicalFeature" with subclasses like "SedimentaryRock," "IgneousRock," etc.
2. Create properties such as "hasGranularity", "isHardenedBy" (for various processes like pressure, temperature, water loss), and others to describe the characteristics of each GeologicalFeature.
3. Create a class "HydrocarbonProperty" with properties like "amount," "value," etc., representing the different aspects that characterize hydrocarbons.
4. Create roles for relationships between classes, such as "contains", "definesFunctionAs", or "forms". For example, "SedimentaryRock contains Sandstone" and "SourceRock forms HydrocarbonProperty".
5. Analyze each data point provided, determining which class(es) it best fits and creating relationships accordingly.
