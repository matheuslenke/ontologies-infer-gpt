 [{
    "name": "BalanceSupport",
    "inferred_stereotype": "role",
    "explanation": "This seems to be a role or function performed by something or someone, as it is related to maintaining balance."
}, {
    "name": "Object Lifter",
    "inferred_stereotype": "role",
    "explanation": "Like BalanceSupport, Object Lifter seems to be a role or function related to physical action."
}, {
    "name": "Electricity Consumption",
    "inferred_stereotype": "mode",
    "explanation": "Electricity Consumption appears to represent a specific condition or property that doesn't have a value in a conceptual space."
}, {
    "name": "Being Supported",
    "inferred_stereotype": "roleMixin",
    "explanation": "Since this is related to support, it could be a semi-rigid type defining properties essential to some instances (things or beings) and accidental to others."
}, {
    "name": "Being Lifted",
    "inferred_stereotype": "roleMixin",
    "explanation": "This could also be a semi-rigid type, as it seems related to the act of being lifted or moved in some way."
}, {
    "name": "Battery",
    "inferred_stereotype": "category",
    "explanation": "It is a rigid type defining essential properties for its instances, in this case, a portable source of electrical energy."
}, {
    "name": "Balance Supporter",
    "inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
    "explanation": "Since it is a type of BalanceSupport and seems to have specific characteristics that make it unique, it can be considered as a rigid specialization of BalanceSupport."
}, {
    "name": "Electricity Source",
    "inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
    "explanation": "Similar to Battery, this appears to be a specialized type of Electricity Consumption."
}, {
    "name": "Robot Handle",
    "inferred_stereotype": "type",
    "explanation": "It seems to be a specific type or category of object within the larger context of robot manipulation."
}, {
    "name": "Robot",
    "inferred_stereotype": "kind",
    "explanation": "Robot can be considered as a fundamental endurant type with uniform principles of individuation, identity, and persistence for its instances."
}, {
    "name": "Patient",
    "inferred_stereotype": "collective",
    "explanation": "In many contexts, 'patient' refers to a group or collection of individuals undergoing similar treatment or processes. So it could be a Collective entity."
}, {
    "name": "LiftUp",
    "inferred_stereotype": "event",
    "explanation": "This seems to be an occurrence, happening or happening process in time."
}, {
    "name": "Electricity Consumer",
    "inferred_stereotype": "instance",
    "explanation": "Instances are individual examples of types, so Electricity Consumer appears to be an instance of the type Electricity Consumption."
