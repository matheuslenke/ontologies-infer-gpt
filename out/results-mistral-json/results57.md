    {
        "name": "Environment Object",
        "inferred_stereotype": "kind",
        "explanation": "As it is a permanent and independent entity within the modeled environment, it can be considered as a 'Kind' in OntoUML."
    },
    {
        "name": "Role",
        "inferred_stereotype": "role",
        "explanation": "A role represents a specific function or action that an entity fulfills within the modeled scenario, thus it can be inferred as 'Role' in OntoUML."
    },
    {
        "name": "Initiating Event",
        "inferred_stereotype": "event",
        "explanation": "An initiating event is something that marks the start of a process or sequence within the modeled scenario, making it an 'Event' in OntoUML."
    },
    {
        "name": "Kind",
        "inferred_stereotype": "kind",
        "explanation": "A 'Kind' is defined as a fundamental endurant type with uniform principles of individuation, identity, and persistence for its instances. In this context, the term refers to an entity with those properties."
    },
    {
        "name": "Initiating Condition",
        "inferred_stereotype": "phase",
        "explanation": "An initiating condition represents a specific set of contingent intrinsic classification conditions for an event, making it a 'Phase' in OntoUML."
    },
    {
        "name": "Hazard Element",
        "inferred_stereotype": "category",
        "explanation": "A hazard element is defined by essential properties and plays a significant role in the occurrence of mishaps, making it a 'Category' in OntoUML."
    },
    {
        "name": "Hazard",
        "inferred_stereotype": "category",
        "explanation": "A hazard is defined by essential properties and represents a potential source of harm, making it a 'Category' in OntoUML."
    },
    {
        "name": "Situation",
        "inferred_stereotype": "situation",
        "explanation": "A situation is the overall scenario or context in which events take place, making it a 'Situation' in OntoUML."
    },
    {
        "name": "Mishap",
        "inferred_stereotype": "event",
        "explanation": "A mishap is an adverse event or incident, marking the end of a potentially unsafe sequence within the modeled scenario, making it an 'Event' in OntoUML."
    },
    {
        "name": "Mishap Victim",
        "inferred_stereotype": "individual (specific type not defined in the provided options)",
        "explanation": "A mishap victim is a person who has been affected by a mishap. The given OntoUML stereotypes do not explicitly include an individual category; however, it can be inferred as any other individual within the modeled scenario."
    },
    {
        "name": "Disposition",
        "inferred_stereotype": "mixin",
        "explanation": "A disposition represents properties essential to some instances and accidental to others, making it a 'Mixin' in OntoUML."
    },
    {
        "name": "Event",
        "inferred_stereotype": "event",
        "explanation": "An event is an occurrence or happening within the modeled scenario, making it an 'Event' in OntoUML."
    },
    {
        "name": "Initiator Factor",
        "inferred_stereotype": "initiatingRoleMixin (custom stereotype)",
        "explanation": "An initiator factor is a specific condition, action, or entity that sets off the sequence of events leading to a mishap. Although it does not perfectly fit into any existing OntoUML stereotype, it can be inferred as an 'Initiating Role' with properties essential and accidental to the occurrence of a mishap."
    },
    {
        "name": "Initiating Role",
        "inferred_stereotype": "role",
        "explanation": "An initiating role is a specific function or action that triggers a sequence of events, making it a 'Role' in OntoUML."
    },
    {
        "name": "Exposure",
        "inferred_stereotype": "mixin",
        "explanation": "Exposure represents properties essential to some instances and accidental to others, making it a 'Mixin' in OntoUML."
    },
    {
        "name": "Harm TruthMaker",
        "inferred_stereotype": "relator",
        "explanation": "A harm truthmaker is an entity that determines or causes the occurrence of harm within the modeled scenario, making it a 'Relator' in OntoUML."
    },
    {
        "name": "Relator",
        "inferred_stereotype": "relator",
        "explanation": "A relator establishes relationships between other entities within the modeled scenario, making it a 'Relator' in OntoUML."
