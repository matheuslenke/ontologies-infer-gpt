    {
        "name": "Leaf_Wetting_Duration",
        "inferred_stereotype": "event",
        "explanation": "As it represents a time-based occurrence or happening, 'event' seems the most appropriate stereotype."
    },
    {
        "name": "Oher_Variables",
        "inferred_stereotype": "mixin",
        "explanation": "Since it can potentially be an essential property for some instances and accidental for others, 'mixin' appears to be a suitable stereotype."
    },
    {
        "name": "Digital_Images",
        "inferred_stereotype": "quantity",
        "explanation": "As it represents portions of matter or objects, the 'quantity' stereotype seems fitting for Digital_Images."
    },
    {
        "name": "Percentage",
        "inferred_stereotype": "quality",
        "explanation": "Being a measure of a property or attribute, 'quality' appears to be the best fit as its stereotype."
    },
    {
        "name": "TIFF",
        "inferred_stereotype": "event",
        "explanation": "As it is likely associated with an image file format creation, 'event' could be a plausible choice."
    },
    {
        "name": "Satellite_Images",
        "inferred_stereotype": "quantity",
        "explanation": "Given that it represents multiple images taken from satellites, 'quantity' seems appropriate as its stereotype."
    },
    {
        "name": "Maximum_Temperature",
        "inferred_stereotype": "quality",
        "explanation": "'Maximum_Temperature' represents a specific value in the conceptual space for temperature, so 'quality' seems to be the best choice."
    },
    {
        "name": "Milimeters",
        "inferred_stereotype": "quantity",
        "explanation": "'Milimeters' are a measure of length in the metric system and hence, can be considered as 'quantity'."
    },
    {
        "name": "Hours/day",
        "inferred_stereotype": "mode",
        "explanation": "As it denotes time measurements without being part of a conceptual space, 'mode' seems to be the appropriate stereotype for this entity."
    },
    {
        "name": "Crop",
        "inferred_stereotype": "kind",
        "explanation": "Since it represents an independent agricultural plant type, 'kind' appears to be a suitable stereotype choice."
    },
    {
        "name": "Air_Relative_Humidity",
        "inferred_stereotype": "quality",
        "explanation": "Being a measure of the water vapor concentration in air, it is a 'quality'."
    },
    {
        "name": "Climate_Station",
        "inferred_stereotype": "situation",
        "explanation": "'Climate_Station' represents an event or phenomenon that happens at a specific location and time, so it can be categorized as 'situation'."
    },
    {
        "name": "Degrees_Celsius",
        "inferred_stereotype": "quality",
        "explanation": "'Degrees_Celsius' is a measure of temperature, so it can be considered as 'quality'."
    },
    {
        "name": "NDVI_Index",
        "inferred_stereotype": "mode",
        "explanation": "Being a remote-sensing tool for vegetation analysis without being part of a conceptual space, it can be categorized as 'mode'."
    },
    {
        "name": "Accumulated_Precipitation",
        "inferred_stereotype": "quality",
        "explanation": "'Accumulated_Precipitation' is a measure of the total amount of precipitation that has fallen over time, so it can be considered as 'quality'."
    },
    {
        "name": "Geolocation",
        "inferred_stereotype": "kind",
        "explanation": "'Geolocation' represents a specific place on Earth, making it an independent entity that falls under the 'kind' category."
    },
    {
        "name": "Production_Evolution_States",
        "inferred_stereotype": "kind",
        "explanation": "'Production_Evolution_States' are likely to represent different phases or stages of crop production, making them independent entities and suitable for the 'kind' stereotype."
    },
    {
        "name": "Minimum_Temperature",
        "inferred_stereotype": "quality",
        "explanation": "'Minimum_Temperature' represents a specific value in the conceptual space for temperature, so it can be considered as 'quality'."
    }
