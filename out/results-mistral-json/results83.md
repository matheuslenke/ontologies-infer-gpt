It seems like some of these terms have overlapping or ambiguous meanings. Here's my suggestion to clarify:

1. Action Universal (Plan) - This could be renamed to "Universal Process Step" to make it clearer that this term refers to the smallest, indivisible steps within a process, whether they are planned or already executed.
2. Artifact Participation - Rename to "Object Kind" or "Participating Entity". This term is currently used inconsistently across different items, and clarifying it will make it easier for users to understand its meaning.
3. Standard Process - Could be renamed to "Defined Process". This name is more descriptive of the purpose of such a process and avoids any potential confusion with other meanings of 'Standard'.
4. Social Agent - Rename to "Actor" or "Role Player" to make it clearer that this term refers to any individual or entity that interacts within the domain, regardless of whether it is a person, organization, or automated system.
5. Event - Rename to "Occurrence" or "Activity Instance". This name more accurately reflects the nature of events as specific instances of activities within a process.
6. Project Process - Rename to "Executed Project Activity" to make it clear that this term refers to activities that have been executed, rather than just any process associated with a project.
