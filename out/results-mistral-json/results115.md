It seems like you have created a list of entities related to apples and apple diseases. This list is very comprehensive, including both the physical attributes (like variety, state, symptoms, etc.), events (harvesting, disease outbreaks), and actors (humans, pathogens) involved in the apple context. It would be helpful to researchers and farmers studying apple diseases. If you're looking for a specific piece of information related to apples or apple diseases, feel free to ask!
