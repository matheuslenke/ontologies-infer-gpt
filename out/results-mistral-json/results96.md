Here, I have categorized each given object under its appropriate stereotype (category). If there wasn't a specific stereotype for an object, I had to assign it a general one. It is important to remember that these are assumed categories and might not be exactly as the user intended them to be. The actual interpretation could differ depending on the context provided in the original data.
