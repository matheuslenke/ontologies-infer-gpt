 [
{
    "name": "Project",
    "inferred_stereotype": "Type",
    "explanation": "The 'Project' is a conceptual entity in UFO and can be considered as a type since it represents a category of projects."
},
{
    "name": "UseCase",
    "inferred_stereotype": "Process",
    "explanation": "The 'UseCase' is an instance of a process since it unfolds in time and involves a series of steps."
},
{
    "name": "Requirement",
    "inferred_stereotype": "Non-sortal, Category",
    "explanation": "A 'Requirement' can be considered as a non-sortal type defining essential properties for its instances. It is categorized since it represents a kind or specific type of requirement."
},
{
    "name": "NonFunctionalRequirement",
    "inferred_stereotype": "Non-functional Requirement, Category",
    "explanation": "The 'NonFunctionalRequirement' is a specific type of 'Requirement'. It is considered a category since it defines essential properties for its instances."
},
{
    "name": "EntityType",
    "inferred_stereotype": "Kind or Collective, Sortal",
    "explanation": "The 'EntityType' can be either a kind (if it represents an independent entity) or collective (if it represents an entity with parts fulfilling identical roles), making it a sortal in UFO."
},
{
    "name": "Module",
    "inferred_stereotype": "Subkind or Category, Sortal",
    "explanation": "The 'Module' can be either a rigid specialization of a kind (if it represents a specific type of module) or a category (if it defines essential properties for its instances), making it a sortal in UFO."
},
{
    "name": "FunctionalRequirement",
    "inferred_stereotype": "Functional Requirement, Category",
    "explanation": "The 'FunctionalRequirement' is a specific type of 'Requirement'. It can be considered as a category since it defines essential properties for its instances."
},
{
    "name": "TestCase",
    "inferred_stereotype": "Event or Situation, Process",
    "explanation": "The 'TestCase' is an instance of either an event or a situation and can be considered as a process since it unfolds in time."
},
{
    "name": "EventFlow",
    "inferred_stereotype": "Process, Event",
    "explanation": "The 'EventFlow' represents a flow of events. It is considered an event since it unfolds in time and can be seen as a process since it involves multiple steps."
},
{
    "name": "BusinessRule",
    "inferred_stereotype": "Class or Type, Sortal",
    "explanation": "The 'BusinessRule' is a conceptual entity that can be either a class (if it represents an independent entity) or a type (if it defines essential properties for its instances), making it a sortal in UFO."
},
{
    "name": "RequirementTestCase",
    "inferred_stereotype": "TestCase, Requirement, RoleMixin",
    "explanation": "The 'RequirementTestCase' is a 'TestCase' that also represents a requirement. It can be considered as having the 'RoleMixin' stereotype since it fulfills a specific role as a test case for requirements."
},
{
    "name": "UseCase",
    "inferred_stereotype": "Process, Event",
    "explanation": "The 'UseCase' is an instance of either an event or a process and can be considered as a process since it unfolds in time."
},
{
    "name": "Class",
    "inferred_stereotype": "Kind or Collective, Sortal",
    "explanation": "The 'Class' is a conceptual entity that can be either a kind (if it represents an independent entity) or a collective (if it represents an entity with parts fulfilling identical roles), making it a sortal in UFO."
},
{
    "name": "Artifact",
    "inferred_stereotype": "EntityType, Type",
    "explanation": "The 'Artifact' is a conceptual entity that represents an 'EntityType'. It can be considered as a type since it defines essential properties for its instances."
},
{
    "name": "Condition",
    "inferred_stereotype": "Class, Sortal or RoleMixin",
    "explanation": "The 'Condition' is a conceptual entity that can be considered as a class (if it represents an independent entity) or a role (if it fulfills a specific function), making it either a sortal in UFO or a role mixin."
},
{
    "name": "BasicFlow",
    "inferred_stereotype": "Process, Basic Flow",
    "explanation": "The 'BasicFlow' represents a basic flow of events. It is considered a process since it unfolds in time and represents the normal sequence of steps."
},
{
    "name": "ClassTestCase",
    "inferred_stereotype": "TestCase, Class, RoleMixin",
    "explanation": "The 'ClassTestCase' is a 'TestCase' that also tests a class. It can be considered as having the 'RoleMixin' stereotype since it fulfills a specific role as a test case for classes."
},
{
    "name": "Postcondition",
    "inferred_stereotype": "Condition or Functional Requirement, Condition",
    "explanation": "The 'Postcondition' represents either a condition (if it defines a state that must hold at the end of a process) or a functional requirement (if it specifies what a system should achieve after executing), making it a condition in UFO."
},
{
    "name": "AlternativeFlow",
    "inferred_stereotype": "Process, Alternative Flow",
    "explanation": "The 'AlternativeFlow' represents an alternative flow of events. It is considered a process since it unfolds in time and represents a different sequence of steps."
},
{
    "name": "Precondition",
    "inferred_stereotype": "Condition or Functional Requirement, Condition",
    "explanation": "The 'Precondition' represents either a condition (if it defines a state that must hold before initiating a process) or a functional requirement (if it specifies the initial requirements for a system to perform), making it a condition in UFO."
