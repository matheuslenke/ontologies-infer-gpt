 [
{
    "name": "event",
    "inferred_stereotype": "event",
    "explanation": "It is an instance of a temporal occurrence that can unfold in time."
},
{
    "name": "active_entity",
    "inferred_sortal": "role",
    "explanation": "Active entities typically play a role in the context, and roles are sorts that have contingent relational classification conditions."
},
{
    "name": "input",
    "inferred_sortal": "category",
    "explanation": "Input typically represents essential properties for its instances within a given process or system."
},
{
    "name": "biological_entity",
    "inferred_sortal": "kind",
    "explanation": "Biological entities are fundamental endurant types with uniform principles of individuation, identity, and persistence for their instances."
},
{
    "name": "biological_event",
    "inferred_stereotype": "event",
    "explanation": "It is an instance of a specific occurrence related to biology."
},
{
    "name": "string",
    "inferred_sortal": "non-sortals",
    "explanation": "Strings represent sequences of characters and are typically not classified as a sortal in UFO."
},
{
    "name": "pathway",
    "inferred_sortal": "process",
    "explanation": "Pathways are sequences of events or series of actions leading to a specific biological function, hence it is categorized as a process."
},
{
    "name": "role_in_biological_event",
    "inferred_sortal": "role",
    "explanation": "Roles typically play a part in the context and have contingent relational classification conditions. In this case, it refers to entities playing a role within biological events."
},
{
    "name": "participation_in_biological_event",
    "inferred_sortal": "participation",
    "explanation": "Participation in biological event refers to the act of taking part in or contributing to an event. It is a participational relation between entities and events."
},
{
    "name": "output",
    "inferred_sortal": "category",
    "explanation": "Output typically represents essential properties for its instances within a given process or system."
},
{
    "name": "Entity_in_process",
    "inferred_sortal": "role",
    "explanation": "Entities in a process play an active part or role, hence it is categorized as a sortal with contingent relational classification conditions."
},
{
    "name": "process",
    "inferred_stereotype": "event",
    "explanation": "It is an instance of a sequence or series of actions, or changes taking place over time in the system, typically associated with a specific function or purpose."
},
{
    "name": "int",
    "inferred_sortal": "non-sortals",
    "explanation": "Integers represent discrete whole numbers and are not classified as a sortal in UFO."
},
{
    "name": "regulator",
    "inferred_sortal": "category",
    "explanation": "Regulators are entities that control or influence the function, behavior, or development of a process, system or another entity. Hence, it represents essential properties for its instances."
},
{
    "name": "degraded_entity",
    "inferred_sortal": "category",
    "explanation": "Degraded entities are those that have undergone a change or transformation from their original state, typically representing essential properties for such instances."
