    },
    {
        "name": "Pipeline",
        "inferred_stereotype": "operation",
        "explanation": "A pipeline is a behavioral design pattern that allows multiple processing objects to pass an input from one stage of processing to another. It's useful when the order of execution and interaction between stages matters, so it fits the 'operation' stereotype."
