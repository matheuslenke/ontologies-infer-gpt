    {
        "name": "FT Sk Output - Sk AP Binded",
        "inferred_stereotype": "process",
        "explanation": "The combination of FT output, SK, and AP binding suggests a process in which data is sent from one entity to another."

        "name": "A Sk Input - Sk AP Binded",
        "inferred_stereotype": "process",
        "explanation": "The input of A and SK being binded with AP indicates a process in which data is received for processing."

        "name": "Adaptation Sink Output",
        "inferred_stereotype": "event",
        "explanation": "An output from an adaptation sink would be considered an event as it marks the conclusion of a process or action."
    },
    {
        "name": "Adaptation Source",
        "inferred_stereotype": "situation",
        "explanation": "An adaptation source may be viewed as a situation that initiates the adaptation process."
    },
    {
        "name": "Transport Processing Function",
        "inferred_stereotype": "process",
        "explanation": "This term refers to a function that transports and processes data, which is typically considered a process."
    },
    {
        "name": "Flow Termination Function",
        "inferred_stereotype": "event",
        "explanation": "The end of a process or the conclusion of flow may be seen as an event."

    {
        "name": "Adaptation Source Output",
        "inferred_stereotype": "event",
        "explanation": "An output from an adaptation source would likely be considered an event, as it initiates the data flow or process."
    },
    {
        "name": "Flow Termination Source Output",
        "inferred_stereotype": "event",
        "explanation": "The termination of a source could also be seen as an event, as it concludes the flow from that specific entity."
    },
    {
        "name": "FT So Input - So AP Binded",
        "inferred_stereotype": "process",
        "explanation": "Similar to the previous combination of terms, this implies a process in which data is received for further action."

        "name": "Adaptation Source Input",
        "inferred_stereotype": "situation",
        "explanation": "An input to an adaptation source could be seen as a situation that provides the data necessary for adapting or processing."

    {
        "name": "A So Output - So AP Binding",
        "inferred_stereotype": "event",
        "explanation": "The output of A, the source, and binding with AP could be seen as an event marking the completion of the adaptation process."
    },
    {
        "name": "Source AP",
        "inferred_stereotype": "type",
        "explanation": "It is hard to infer a specific stereotype without context, but based on common usage, Source AP could be considered as a type or category of entity."
    },
    {
        "name": "Flow Termination Source",
        "inferred_stereotype": "type",
        "explanation": "Like the previous term, it is difficult to infer a specific stereotype without context. However, Flow Termination Source could be considered as a type or category of entity."

        "name": "Adaptation Sink Input",
        "inferred_stereotype": "situation",
        "explanation": "An input to an adaptation sink is likely a situation that provides data for the sink to adapt or process."
    },

        "name": "Flow Termination Sink Input",
        "inferred_stereotype": "situation",
        "explanation": "The input of a flow termination sink could be seen as a situation that triggers the termination event."
    },
    {
        "name": "Source AP Binding",
        "inferred_stereotype": "binding",
        "explanation": "Binding refers to a connection between entities, which is not classified under an event or process stereotype."
