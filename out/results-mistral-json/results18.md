 [{
    "name": "UpperPhase",
    "inferred_stereotype": "phase",
    "explanation": "As it represents a sortal with contingent intrinsic classification conditions, it can be considered a phase according to UFO."
}, {
    "name": "Regulation",
    "inferred_stereotype": "role",
    "explanation": "As it is related to the performance of actions or the functioning of something, it can be seen as a role in UFO."
}, {
    "name": "Element",
    "inferred_stereotype": "individual",
    "explanation": "Elements can be individuals existing in time with all their parts, and they are not classified as endurant or perdurant types, so the general individual stereotype is applicable."
}, {
    "name": "Subject",
    "inferred_stereotype": "kind",
    "explanation": "As it is a fundamental endurant type with uniform principles of individuation, identity, and persistence for its instances, it can be considered a kind according to UFO."
}, {
    "name": "Module_Phase",
    "inferred_stereotype": "phaseMixin",
    "explanation": "As it defines contingent properties for its instances, it can be classified as a phase-mixin according to UFO."
}, {
    "name": "Degree",
    "inferred_stereotype": "quantity",
    "explanation": "Being a portion of matter makes Degree fit the quantity stereotype."
}, {
    "name": "Variant",
    "inferred_stereotype": "phaseMixin",
    "explanation": "As it defines contingent properties for its instances, it can be classified as a phase-mixin according to UFO."
}, {
    "name": "DegreeRegulation",
    "inferred_stereotype": "mixin",
    "explanation": "Properties essential to some instances and accidental to others make DegreeRegulation fit the mixin stereotype."
}, {
    "name": "PhaseWithModule",
    "inferred_stereotype": "phaseMixin",
    "explanation": "As it defines contingent properties for its instances, it can be classified as a phase-mixin according to UFO."
}, {
    "name": "Element_Module",
    "inferred_stereotype": "relation",
    "explanation": "The relation between an element and a module is not specified in the provided information, but since it represents a connection between entities, it can be considered a relation."
}, {
    "name": "Sub_Phase",
    "inferred_stereotype": "phaseMixin",
    "explanation": "As it defines contingent properties for its instances, it can be classified as a phase-mixin according to UFO."
}, {
    "name": "Var_Reg",
    "inferred_stereotype": "roleMixin",
    "explanation": "Properties essential to some instances and accidental to others make Var_Reg fit the roleMixin stereotype."
}, {
    "name": "VariationReg",
    "inferred_stereotype": "mixin",
    "explanation": "Properties essential to some instances and accidental to others make VariationReg fit the mixin stereotype."
}, {
    "name": "SubPhase",
    "inferred_stereotype": "phaseMixin",
    "explanation": "As it defines contingent properties for its instances, it can be classified as a phase-mixin according to UFO."
}, {
    "name": "Module",
    "inferred_stereotype": "individual",
    "explanation": "Individuals are entities existing in time with all their parts, so Module fits the individual stereotype."
