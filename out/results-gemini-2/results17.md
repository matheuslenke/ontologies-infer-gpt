1 - Reading the names of the elements:
degraded_entity, role_in_biological_event, regulator, Entity_in_process, int, process, active_entity, pathway, biological_entity, output, biological_event, input, participation_in_biological_event, event

2 - Inferring ONE possible OntoUML stereotype for each element:
    - degraded_entity: **roleMixin**
    - role_in_biological_event: **role**
    - regulator: **subkind**
    - Entity_in_process: **role**
    - int: **type**
    - process: **process**
    - active_entity: **roleMixin**
    - pathway: **subkind**
    - biological_entity: **kind**
    - output: **role**
    - biological_event: **event**
    - input: **role**
    - participation_in_biological_event: **participation**
    - event: **event**

3 - Providing the explanation for each stereotype inferred:
    - **degraded_entity**: Represents a contingent property of a biological entity, as being degraded may not be an essential characteristic.
    - **role_in_biological_event**: Represents a role that a biological entity plays within a specific biological event.
    - **regulator**: Assuming a broader context where regulators are specialized types of entities, like in biology, this would be a specialization of a kind.
    - **Entity_in_process**: Represents the role an entity takes within a process.
    - **int**: A generic type for integer values, which can be used in various contexts.
    - **process**: Represents a series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end.
    - **active_entity**: Represents a contingent property of a biological entity. It describes a state or condition that may not be permanent or defining.
    - **pathway**: Represents a specialized type of biological process, suggesting a more specific and well-defined series of events.
    - **biological_entity**: Represents a fundamental kind of entity in a biological context, encompassing various types of life forms.
    - **output**: Represents the role something plays as the result of an event or process.
    - **biological_event**: Represents an occurrence or happening within a biological system.
    - **input**: Represents the role something plays as an element that goes into an event or process.
    - **participation_in_biological_event**: Represents the act of participating in a biological event.
    - **event**: Represents a general occurrence or happening.
