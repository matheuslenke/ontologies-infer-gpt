1 - Read the name of every element:
decrement-event
to
take
economic-agent
duality
transformation
inflow
consume
economic-resource
outflow
economic-event
give
from
outside-party
transfer-duality
increment-event
stock-flow
inside-party
produce
transformation-duality
transfer
trading-partner
participation

2 - Infer ONE possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype:
decrement-event: event
to: *already a stereotype*
take: phaseMixin
economic-agent: kind
duality: relator
transformation: process
inflow: *already a stereotype*
consume: phaseMixin
economic-resource: kind
outflow: *already a stereotype*
economic-event: event
give: phaseMixin
from: *already a stereotype*
outside-party: role
transfer-duality: relator
increment-event: event
stock-flow: *already a stereotype*
inside-party: role
produce: phaseMixin
transformation-duality: relator
transfer: process
trading-partner: role
participation: *already a stereotype*

3 - Provide the explanation for each stereotype inferred:
decrement-event: Represents a decrement event, a perdurant type.
take: Represents the state of an economic agent taking something, which is an anti-rigid type that defines contingent properties.
economic-agent: Represents a kind of entity that can engage in economic activities.
duality: Represents the relationship between two complementary aspects.
transformation: Represents a process of change.
consume: Represents the state of an agent consuming a resource, which is an anti-rigid type that defines contingent properties.
economic-resource: Represents a kind of resource that has economic value.
economic-event: Represents an event related to economic activities, a perdurant type.
give: Represents the state of an economic agent giving something, which is an anti-rigid type that defines contingent properties.
outside-party: Represents the role of an entity external to a specific economic transaction.
transfer-duality: Represents the dual nature of a transfer, a relator type.
increment-event: Represents an increment event, a perdurant type.
inside-party: Represents the role of an entity internal to a specific economic transaction.
produce: Represents the state of an agent producing something, which is an anti-rigid type that defines contingent properties.
transformation-duality: Represents the dual nature of a transformation.
transfer: Represents the process of transferring something.
trading-partner: Represents the role of an entity involved in a trading relationship.

4 - Output a json array, where each object contains the following keys: name, inferred_stereotype, explanation:
