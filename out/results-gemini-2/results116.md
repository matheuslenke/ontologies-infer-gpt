2 - Inferring OntoUML stereotypes:
    - "ki passed": **phase**
        - Explanation: It represents a contingent, intrinsic change in the state of a Chapter (ki), likely indicating whether it's been covered in the course or not.
    - "t non passed": **phase**
        - Explanation:  Similar to "ki passed", it represents a contingent, intrinsic change in the state of a Test (t), likely indicating if it hasn't been successfully completed.
    - "Teacher": **role** 
        - Explanation: Represents a role that a Person can hold within the context of a Course.
    - "Course started": **phase**
        - Explanation: Denotes a change in the state of a Course, marking its transition to an active state. 
    - "Person": **kind**
        - Explanation: A fundamental type representing individual humans.
    - "Student": **role**
        - Explanation: Represents a role that a Person can assume within an educational context.
    - "Chapter(ki)": **kind** 
        - Explanation: Represents individual chapters, fundamental units within a Course.
    - "ki non passed": **phase**
        - Explanation: Like "ki passed", it represents a contingent, intrinsic state of a Chapter, likely indicating it hasn't been covered.
    - "Credit passed": **mode**
        - Explanation: Represents a particularized property of having earned credit, likely associated with passing elements of a Course. 
    - "t passed": **phase**
        - Explanation: Similar to "t non passed", it's a contingent, intrinsic state of a Test, likely indicating successful completion.
    - "Credit non passed": **mode**
        - Explanation: Counterpart to "Credit passed", representing the property of not having earned credit.
    - "p passed": **phase**
        - Explanation: A contingent, intrinsic state of a Project (p), likely signifying successful completion.
    - "ci non passed": **phase**
        - Explanation: A contingent, intrinsic state of an Exercise (ci), likely indicating it hasn't been successfully completed. 
    - "p non passed": **phase** 
        - Explanation: Like "p passed", it represents a contingent, intrinsic state of a Project, likely signifying non-completion.
    - "Project(p)": **kind**
        - Explanation: Represents individual projects, fundamental units within a Course.
    - "Exercise(ci)": **kind** 
        - Explanation: Represents individual exercises, fundamental units within a Course.
    - "Course": **kind** 
        - Explanation:  Represents individual courses, a fundamental concept in an educational context.
    - "Test(t)": **kind**
        - Explanation: Represents individual tests, fundamental units within a Course.
    - "ci passed": **phase**
        - Explanation: Similar to "ci non passed", it's a contingent, intrinsic state of an Exercise, indicating likely successful completion.
