1 - Reading the name of every element:
Milimeters, Maximum_Temperature, Climate_Station, Air_Relative_Humidity, Leaf_Wetting_Duration, Degrees_Celsius, Crop, Satellite_Images, Minimum_Temperature, Digital_Images, TIFF, NDVI_Index, Percentage, Geolocation, Accumulated_Precipitation, Oher_Variables, Hours/day, Production_Evolution_States

2 - Inferring ONE possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype:

- **Milimeters**: quantity - Represents a unit of measurement for length, a portion of a homeomerous amount of matter.
- **Maximum_Temperature**: quality - Represents a specific temperature value within a range, which can be measured in a conceptual space (Degrees_Celsius).
- **Climate_Station**: kind - Represents a type of physical entity designed for collecting weather data.
- **Air_Relative_Humidity**: quality - Represents the amount of moisture present in the air, a value in a conceptual space that can be measured (Percentage).
- **Leaf_Wetting_Duration**: quantity - Represents the duration of time, which can be measured (Hours/day).
- **Degrees_Celsius**: quantity - Represents a unit of measurement for temperature, a portion of a homeomerous amount of matter.
- **Crop**: kind - Represents a type of plant cultivated for food or other purposes.
- **Satellite_Images**: kind - Represents a type of image captured by satellites, existing independently.
- **Minimum_Temperature**: quality - Represents a specific temperature value within a range, which can be measured in a conceptual space (Degrees_Celsius).
- **Digital_Images**: kind - Represents a broad category of images created or stored digitally.
- **TIFF**: subkind - Represents a specific file format of digital images, specializing the kind 'Digital_Images'.
- **NDVI_Index**: quality - Represents a specific value derived from remote sensing data, existing in a conceptual space.
- **Percentage**: quantity - Represents a unit of measurement for ratios, a portion of a homeomerous amount of matter.
- **Geolocation**: quality - Represents a specific location on Earth's surface, a value in a conceptual space.
- **Accumulated_Precipitation**: quantity - Represents the total amount of precipitation over a period, a portion of a homeomerous amount of matter (Milimeters).
- **Oher_Variables**: mixin - Represents a collection of unspecified properties that can be applied to various entities.
- **Hours/day**: quantity - Represents a unit of measurement for time, a portion of a homeomerous amount of matter.
- **Production_Evolution_States**: phase - Represents distinct stages or phases in the production process of something (e.g., Crop).
