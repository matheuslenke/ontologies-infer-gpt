},
{
"name": "Extendable Class",
"inferred_stereotype": "phaseMixin",
"explanation": "Extendable Class refers to a class that is designed for extension, allowing other classes to inherit from it and potentially override or add to its behavior. This extensibility can be considered a contingent property as it's not inherently required for all classes."

{
"name": "Table per Class Inheritance Mapping",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "Table per Class Inheritance Mapping represents a specific strategy for mapping inheritance hierarchies to databases, where each class in the hierarchy gets its own table."

"name": "Table per Concrete Class Inheritance Mapping",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "Table per Concrete Class Inheritance Mapping is a specific inheritance mapping strategy where only concrete classes (those that can be instantiated) get their own tables."
