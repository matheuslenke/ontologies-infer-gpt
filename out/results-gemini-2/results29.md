1 - Reading the name of every element:
Recommendation
Referencing
Recomendation
char
Publication
Concept
Recommendation Version
Indirectly
Referenced Concept
Concept Definition
Possibly
Problematic
Correct
Problematic Concetp
int

2 - Inferring ONE possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype:
Recommendation: kind
Referencing: relator
Recomendation: kind
char: mode
Publication: kind
Concept: kind
Recommendation Version: subkind
Indirectly: roleMixin
Referenced Concept: role
Concept Definition: relator
Possibly: phaseMixin
Problematic: roleMixin
Correct: subkind
Problematic Concetp: subkind
int: mode

3 - Providing the explanation for each stereotype inferred:
Recommendation: Represents a fundamental type of entity.
Referencing: Represents a relationship between other entities.
Recomendation: Represents a fundamental type of entity. Note: This appears to be a misspelling of "Recommendation".
char: Represents a property that is not a value in a conceptual space.
Publication: Represents a fundamental type of entity.
Concept: Represents a fundamental type of entity.
Recommendation Version: Represents a rigid specialization of a kind.
Indirectly: Represents a type that defines contingent properties, and its instantiation depends on relational conditions.
Referenced Concept: Represents an anti-rigid specialization of a kind, dependent on its relation to another entity.
Concept Definition: Represents an entity that acts as a truthmaker for a material relation.
Possibly: Represents a type that defines contingent properties, and its instantiation depends on intrinsic contingent conditions.
Problematic: Represents a type that defines contingent properties, and its instantiation depends on relational conditions.
Correct: Represents a rigid specialization of a kind.
Problematic Concetp: Represents a rigid specialization of a kind. Note: This appears to be a misspelling of "Concept".
int: Represents a property that is not a value in a conceptual space.
