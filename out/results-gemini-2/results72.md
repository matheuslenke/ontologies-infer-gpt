2 - Inferring stereotypes...
    - Value Object: **kind**
    - Benefit-specific valuation: **subkind**
    - VO's functional quality: **role**
    - VO's quality: **mixin**
    - Desire: **mode**
    - Preference: **mode**
    - Benefit value: **quality** 
    - Perceived value: **quality**
    - Quality domain: **category**
    - VO's non-functional quality: **role**
    - Context involvement relationship: **relator**
    - Theoretical value: **quality**
    - Agent: **kind**
    - Theoretical valuation relationship: **relator**
    - Cost-specific valuation: **subkind**
    - Context: **kind**
    - Cost value: **quality**
3 - Providing explanation for each stereotype...
    - Value Object: **kind**, because it is a fundamental sort of endurant type, representing objects that hold value.
    - Benefit-specific valuation: **subkind**, because it is a specialization of valuation based on benefits.
    - VO's functional quality: **role**, because it represents the functional qualities that a Value Object plays.
    - VO's quality: **mixin**, because it represents qualities common to Value Objects.
    - Desire: **mode**, because it represents the state of desiring something.
    - Preference: **mode**, because it represents the state of preferring something over another.
    - Benefit value: **quality**, because it represents a measurable aspect of benefit.
    - Perceived value: **quality**, because it is a measure of how much something is valued.
    - Quality domain: **category**, because it is a group of related qualities.
    - VO's non-functional quality: **role**, because it represents non-functional qualities of a Value Object.
    - Context involvement relationship: **relator**, because it is a relationship that involves a Context.
    - Theoretical value: **quality**, because it represents the theoretical aspect of value.
    - Agent: **kind**, because it represents an entity capable of taking actions.
    - Theoretical valuation relationship: **relator**, because it is a relationship that involves theoretical valuation.
    - Cost-specific valuation: **subkind**, because it is a specialization of valuation based on cost.
    - Context: **kind**, because it represents the circumstances surrounding something.
    - Cost value: **quality**, because it represents the monetary or non-monetary worth of something.
