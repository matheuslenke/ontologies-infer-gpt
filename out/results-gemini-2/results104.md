{
"name": "LivingPerson",
"inferred_stereotype": "phaseMixin",
"explanation": "LivingPerson represents a temporary phase that an instance of the kind Person can go through. It defines contingent properties that apply to a person during a specific period of their life."
},
{
"name": "TimeSeriesMeasurements",
"inferred_stereotype": "collective",
"explanation": "TimeSeriesMeasurements represents a collection of individual measurements taken over a period of time. Each measurement in the time series contributes to the collective as a whole."
},
{
"name": "ECGLeadBipolarLimb",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "ECGLeadBipolarLimb represents a specific type of ECGLead that is characterized by its placement on the limbs and the use of two electrodes. It inherits the properties of ECGLead and introduces additional constraints related to its specific configuration."
},
{
"name": "Property",
"inferred_stereotype": "category",
"explanation": "Property is a general concept that encompasses a wide range of attributes or characteristics that can be associated with different entities. It serves as a high-level category that groups together specific types of properties."
},
{
"name": "ECGRecordingSession",
"inferred_stereotype": "situation",
"explanation": "ECGRecordingSession represents a specific period of time during which ECG data is being recorded. It is a complex event that involves various participants, such as the patient, the ECG device, and the healthcare professional."
},
{
"name": "float",
"inferred_stereotype": "type",
"explanation": "The \"float\" data type represents a subset of numbers that include decimal points. It is commonly used to store and manipulate numerical values with fractional components in computer science and programming."
},
{
"name": "ElectricPotential",
"inferred_stereotype": "quantity",
"explanation": "ElectricPotential represents a measurable physical quantity that describes the electrical potential energy difference between two points. It is typically measured in volts (V)."
},
{
"name": "Sensor",
"inferred_stereotype": "role",
"explanation": "Sensor represents a functional role that a physical device or component can play. A sensor is designed to detect and measure specific physical phenomena, such as temperature, pressure, or light."
},
{
"name": "ECGDevice",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "ECGDevice represents a specialized type of device that is specifically designed for recording electrocardiograms. It inherits general properties from the kind Device and adds specific features related to ECG measurements."
},
{
"name": "ECGLeadUnipolar",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "Similar to ECGLeadBipolarLimb, ECGLeadUnipolar is another subkind of ECGLead. It uses one electrode as the main point of reference, distinguishing it from the bipolar configuration."
},
{
"name": "BiologicalPerson",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "BiologicalPerson is a more specific categorization within the broader concept of Person. It focuses on the biological aspects and characteristics of a human being."
},
{
"name": "ECGLead",
"inferred_stereotype": "kind",
"explanation": "ECGLead represents a fundamental concept in electrocardiography, referring to the specific configuration of electrodes used to measure electrical activity from the heart. It serves as a basis for different types of ECG leads, such as bipolar and unipolar leads."
},
{
"name": "Measurement",
"inferred_stereotype": "kind",
"explanation": "Measurement represents a fundamental concept that involves assigning a numerical value or a qualitative description to a specific property of an entity. It is a fundamental aspect of scientific observation and data collection."
},
{
"name": "Task",
"inferred_stereotype": "kind",
"explanation": "Task refers to a well-defined unit of work or activity that has a specific goal or objective. It can involve a sequence of steps, resources, and a defined outcome."
},
{
"name": "HeartElectricalActivity",
"inferred_stereotype": "kind",
"explanation": "HeartElectricalActivity represents the inherent electrical activity generated by the heart. It is a fundamental physiological process that governs the heart's contractions and rhythm."
},
{
"name": "ECGSampleSequence",
"inferred_stereotype": "collective",
"explanation": "ECGSampleSequence represents a collection of individual ECG samples taken at regular intervals. The sequence captures the dynamic changes in electrical activity over time."
},
{
"name": "PersonUnderECGMonitoring",
"inferred_stereotype": "role",
"explanation": "PersonUnderECGMonitoring describes a person who is currently undergoing ECG monitoring. It is a temporary role that a person assumes during a medical examination or treatment."
