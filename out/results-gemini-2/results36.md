1 - Read the name of every element:
Robot, Electricity Source, Balance Supporter, Electricity Consumer, Patient, Object Lifter, Being Supported, BalanceSupport, Electricity Consumption, Being Lifted, Robot Handle, Battery, LiftUp

2 - Infer ONE possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype:
Robot: kind
Electricity Source: role
Balance Supporter: role
Electricity Consumer: role
Patient: kind
Object Lifter: role
Being Supported: situation
BalanceSupport: situation
Electricity Consumption: situation
Being Lifted: situation
Robot Handle: subkind
Battery: subkind
LiftUp: event

3 - Provide the explanation for each stereotype inferred:
Robot: A robot is a fundamental type of thing that has a well-defined identity, persists through time, and can be individuated from other robots.
Electricity Source: Being an electricity source is a role that something can play. For instance, a power outlet can be an electricity source. 
Balance Supporter: Being a balance supporter is a role that something can play. For example, a cane can be a balance supporter for a person.
Electricity Consumer: Being an electricity consumer is a role that something can play. For example, a computer is an electricity consumer.
Patient: A patient is a fundamental type of thing with a well-defined identity, that persists through time and can be individuated from other patients.
Object Lifter: Being an object lifter is a role that something can play. For example, a crane can be an object lifter.
Being Supported: Being supported is a situation where one thing is providing support to another. It is contingent on the existence of both the supporter and the supported.
BalanceSupport: Balance support is a situation where balance is being provided to an entity.
Electricity Consumption: Electricity consumption is a situation that happens when an entity consumes electricity.
Being Lifted: Being lifted is a situation that happens when something is being lifted by a lifter.
Robot Handle: Robot handle is a specialization of the kind Robot. It represents a more specific type of Robot, one that is designed to have a handle.
Battery: Battery is a specialization of kind. It represents a more specific type of thing that can be used to store and supply electricity.
LiftUp: Lift up is an event of something being lifted up. It has a specific start and end time, and it changes the state of the world.
