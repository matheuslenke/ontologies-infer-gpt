[
{
"name": "FunctionalConcern",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "A Functional Concern is a specific type of Concern, indicating a specialization relationship. It inherits identity conditions from the parent kind 'Concern'."
},
{
"name": "Composition",
"inferred_stereotype": "relator",
"explanation": "Composition represents a relationship, suggesting it links entities. Being named 'Composition' hints at it being a whole-part relation, often implying the existence of a composite entity."
},
{
"name": "Concern",
"inferred_stereotype": "kind",
"explanation": "Used as a basis for specialization into FunctionalConcern, implying it's a fundamental type. Concerns in software often exist independently, suggesting it's a kind rather than reliant on other entities."
},
{
"name": "Relationship",
"inferred_stereotype": "relator",
"explanation": "The generic name 'Relationship' strongly suggests it's meant to connect or link other entities, a primary characteristic of relators in OntoUML."
},
{
"name": "Dependency",
"inferred_stereotype": "relator",
"explanation": "Similar to 'Relationship', 'Dependency' implies a connection between elements. The name suggests a directional reliance of one entity on another, further pointing to a relator stereotype."
},
{
"name": "ContributionType",
"inferred_stereotype": "kind",
"explanation": "The inclusion of 'Type' suggests this element defines a category with instances.  'Contribution' being a broad concept suggests a fundamental, independent entity, hence 'kind'."
},
{
"name": "Contribution",
"inferred_stereotype": "relator",
"explanation": "'Contribution' implies an action or effect one entity has on another. This suggests a link between entities where one's properties or behavior influence another, aligning with the concept of a relator."
},
{
"name": "NonFunctionalConcern",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "Mirroring 'FunctionalConcern', the name indicates a specialized form of 'Concern'. This specialization likely inherits identity from 'Concern' and introduces additional, specific attributes."
},
{
"name": "Keyword",
"inferred_stereotype": "mode",
"explanation": "Keywords are descriptive attributes attached to other entities. They don't exist independently and represent a characteristic or quality of something else, fitting the definition of a 'mode'."
},
{
"name": "SourceType",
"inferred_stereotype": "kind",
"explanation": "The 'Type' suffix suggests a classifier with potential instances. 'Source' being a broad concept, likely independent in a system's context, points to a fundamental type, thus 'kind'."
