3 - Provide the explanation for each stereotype inferred:
    Resource: A fundamental sort of endurant type. Example: Water, food, oil, natural gas.
    Value Proposition: A fundamental sort of endurant type. Example: A product or service that offers a unique set of benefits that are valuable to a customer. 
    Market Competitor:  Represents a role that an individual can hold in the context of a Market. Example: Two companies, A and B, that produce the same product and compete for the same customers in a market. 
    Composed Market: An instance of a class stereotyped collective is a collective entity whose parts (members of the collective) fulfill identical roles in relation to the whole. Example: A market composed of different sub-markets, such as the stock market, the bond market, and the commodities market.
    Capability: A fundamental sort of endurant type. Example: The ability to produce a product or service.
    Potential Competition: Represents anti-rigid types that define contingent properties for their instances. Their instantiation is characterized by intrinsic contingent conditions. Example: A company that is not currently competing in a market, but has the potential to do so in the future.
    Collective Demand: An instance of a class stereotyped collective is a collective entity whose parts (members of the collective) fulfill identical roles in relation to the whole. Example: The total demand for a product or service by all consumers in a market.
    Agent: Represents a role that an individual can hold. Example: A person or organization that acts on behalf of another person or organization.
    Demand for Market: A fundamental sort of endurant type. Example: The demand for a particular product or service in a specific market.
    Indirect Competitor: Subkinds are rigid specializations of a kind. Example: Two companies that produce different products that are substitutes for each other, such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi.
    Potential Competitor: Represents anti-rigid types that define contingent properties for their instances. Their instantiation is characterized by intrinsic contingent conditions. Example: A company that is not currently competing in a market, but has the potential to do so in the future.
    Supplier: Represents a role that an individual can hold in the context of a supply chain. Example: A company that provides goods or services to another company.
    Non-Competition: Represents anti-rigid types that define contingent properties for their instances. Their instantiation is characterized by intrinsic contingent conditions. Example: A situation in which two or more companies agree not to compete with each other.
    Supplier Capability: A fundamental sort of endurant type. Example: The ability of a supplier to provide a particular good or service.
    Resource Demand: A fundamental sort of endurant type. Example: The demand for a particular resource.
    Resource Stock: An instance of a class stereotyped quantity is a portion of homogeneous amount of matter. Example: The total amount of a particular resource that is available.
    Simple Market: Subkinds are rigid specializations of a kind. Example: A market with only a few buyers and sellers.
    Scarce Resource: Subkinds are rigid specializations of a kind. Example: A resource that is in limited supply.
    Market: A fundamental sort of endurant type. Example: A place where buyers and sellers come together to trade goods and services.
    Resource Type: A fundamental sort of endurant type. Example: A category of resources, such as energy resources, mineral resources, or water resources.
    Single Resource: Subkinds are rigid specializations of a kind. Example: A specific type of resource, such as oil, natural gas, or coal.
    Direct Competitor: Subkinds are rigid specializations of a kind. Example: Two companies that produce the same product or service and sell it to the same target market.
    Market Competition: A fundamental sort of endurant type. Example: The rivalry among businesses selling similar products or services.
    Economic Agent: A fundamental sort of endurant type. Example: An individual, household, organization, or government that participates in an economy. 
    Equivalent Capability: Subkinds are rigid specializations of a kind. Example: Two companies that have the same ability to produce a particular product or service.
    Competitor: Represents a role that an individual can hold in the context of a competition. Example: A person or organization that is competing with another person or organization. 
    Competition: A fundamental sort of endurant type. Example: A situation in which two or more parties strive for a common goal which cannot be shared.
