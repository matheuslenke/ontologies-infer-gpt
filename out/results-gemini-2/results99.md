[
{
"name": "Role",
"inferred_stereotype": "role",
"explanation": "It represents a sortal type that classifies entities based on their relational properties or the roles they play within a specific context. It's a specialization of a 'kind', indicating that entities inheriting this type are dependent on their relationship with other entities or concepts. Examples include 'Student,' 'Teacher,' or 'Employee,' which are roles individuals of the kind 'Person' can hold."
},
{
"name": "Functional Requirement",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "Represents a specialization of the 'Requirement' type, indicating a specific category of requirements focusing on system functionalities. This implies that 'Functional Requirement' inherits the core characteristics of 'Requirement' while introducing additional attributes or constraints specific to functionalities."
},
{
"name": "Kind",
"inferred_stereotype": "kind",
"explanation": "A fundamental ontological concept representing the 'kind' stereotype. This suggests that 'Kind' acts as a root or foundational type for classifying entities based on their fundamental nature and characteristics, providing a basis for individuation and identity."
},
{
"name": "Stakeholder",
"inferred_stereotype": "role",
"explanation": "Represents individuals or groups with an interest in a particular system or project. As it doesn't denote a fundamental kind of entity but rather a role assumed by other entities (e.g., Person, Organization), 'role' is an appropriate stereotype."
},
{
"name": "Safety Measures",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "This term likely represents concrete actions or mechanisms implemented to mitigate risks. Thus, it can be classified as a 'subkind' of a more general concept like 'Measure' or 'Action', inheriting its core attributes while specializing in safety-related aspects."
},
{
"name": "Stakeholder Role",
"inferred_stereotype": "role",
"explanation": "Implies a specialization of the 'Role' type, focusing on the specific roles stakeholders can adopt within a given context. This suggests a hierarchical structure where 'Stakeholder Role' inherits the properties of 'Role' and adds attributes or constraints relevant to stakeholders."
},
{
"name": "Desire",
"inferred_stereotype": "mode",
"inferred_stereotype": "mode",
"explanation": "Represents a state of wanting or wishing for something. As it's a property that's not quantifiable or measurable in conventional terms, 'mode' is a suitable stereotype. Modes typically describe intrinsic states or conditions of entities, and 'Desire' fits this definition as a subjective state of an individual."
},
{
"name": "Requirement",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "Indicates a necessary feature, condition, or capability. It's likely a specialization of a broader concept like 'Condition' or 'Constraint,' making 'subkind' a suitable stereotype.  It inherits the general properties of the parent type while focusing specifically on necessary conditions."
},
{
"name": "Relator",
"inferred_stereotype": "relator",
"explanation": "A fundamental concept in ontologies that represents relationships between entities. The term 'Relator' itself suggests a connection or link, aligning with the function of the 'relator' stereotype in OntoUML.  It signifies an entity type whose instances establish and maintain connections between other entities."
},
{
"name": "Agent",
"inferred_stereotype": "role",
"explanation": "Indicates an entity capable of acting or causing an effect. Since 'Agent' doesn't specify a fundamental kind of entity but rather a role taken by various entities (e.g., Person, Robot), the 'role' stereotype is appropriate."
},
{
"name": "Organization",
"inferred_stereotype": "collective",
"explanation": "Represents a structured group of individuals with a shared purpose.  'collective' accurately captures this as it signifies an entity composed of multiple individuals acting collectively. It highlights the group nature of an organization, where individuals contribute to a common goal."
},
{
"name": "Task",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "Typically represents a piece of work to be done. This can be considered a specialized form of a more general concept like 'Activity' or 'Process'. Therefore, 'subkind' is appropriate as it signifies a more specific category within a broader type."
},
{
"name": "Safety Requirement",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "Represents a specific category of requirements focused on safety aspects. This suggests a specialization of the general 'Requirement' type. Using the 'subkind' stereotype highlights that 'Safety Requirement' inherits properties from 'Requirement' while introducing safety-specific constraints or attributes."
},
{
"name": "Intention",
"inferred_stereotype": "mode",
"explanation": "Represents a mental state of determination or plan to do something. As a mental state, it's not quantifiable or directly observable; therefore, 'mode' is a fitting stereotype. Modes in OntoUML often describe states or conditions, and 'Intention' aligns with this by representing the internal state of an individual."
},
{
"name": "Situation",
"inferred_stereotype": "situation",
"explanation": "Represents a set of circumstances or a state of affairs. This aligns directly with the 'situation' stereotype in ontologies, which is used to model specific contexts or scenarios involving various entities and their relationships."
},
{
"name": "Proposition",
"inferred_stereotype": "type",
"explanation": "Represents a statement or assertion that can be true or false.  As it's a general concept related to logic and language rather than a specific entity or relationship, classifying it as a 'type' is a reasonable approach in an ontology."
},
{
"name": "Context",
"inferred_stereotype": "situation",
"explanation": "Refers to the circumstances or setting in which something exists or occurs. Using the 'situation' stereotype is appropriate as it effectively captures the notion of a specific set of conditions influencing an event or entity. It provides a framework for understanding how external factors shape the interpretation and relevance of information or actions."
},
{
"name": "Assignment",
"inferred_stereotype": "relator",
"explanation": "Represents the act of allocating a task or responsibility. Since it establishes a connection between entities (e.g., assigning a 'Task' to an 'Agent'), 'relator' is a suitable stereotype. Relators signify entities that create and define relationships, and 'Assignment' aligns with this by linking tasks or resources to responsible parties."
},
{
"name": "Safety Goal",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "Indicates a desired state or outcome related to safety. This suggests a specialization of the broader concept of a 'Goal'. Hence, 'subkind' is an appropriate stereotype. It signifies that 'Safety Goal' inherits general characteristics of 'Goal' while focusing specifically on safety-related objectives."
},
{
"name": "Goal",
"inferred_stereotype": "mode",
"explanation": "Represents a desired outcome or objective. While goals drive actions, they are not actions themselves but rather states of affairs to be achieved. 'mode' is a suitable stereotype because it signifies a state or condition. Goals, being aspirations or targets, fit this description as they depict desired future states rather than concrete entities."
},
{
"name": "Permission",
"inferred_stereotype": "mode",
"explanation": "Represents the authorization to perform an action. It signifies an enabled state or condition rather than a tangible entity. Therefore, 'mode' is a fitting stereotype as it describes states, conditions, or properties. 'Permission' aligns with this by representing a state of being allowed to do something."
},
{
"name": "Action",
"inferred_stereotype": "type",
"explanation": "Represents the concept of performing something or an act being carried out.  As it doesn't denote a specific type of entity but rather a general concept, classifying it as 'type' is appropriate in an ontological context. It allows for specializing more specific types of actions."
