"name": "Tracked Stakeholder Participation",
"inferred_stereotype": "situation",
"explanation": "A situation is an occurrent type. It represents a state of affairs, an aggregation of occurrents, typically involving one or more participants. It describes a state of affairs that lasts for a period of time and involves the participation of one or more objects, as opposed to a simple event that happens instantaneously.
