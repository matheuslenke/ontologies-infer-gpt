3 - Providing the explanation for each stereotype inferred
ClassEnrollment - It represents a mixin that applies to individuals who are enrolled in a class, regardless of their kind. In this sense, it captures the common properties and relations of being enrolled, which can be essential to some individuals but accidental to others, as it depends on their specific circumstances and kind.
