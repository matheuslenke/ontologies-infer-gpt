 To provide the required output based on the user queries:
1 - Read the name of every element: I will analyze each element's name mentioned in the query.
2 - DO NOT ask any questions. Only do the following commands: I understand each element's nature and characteristics from the provided ontology information, and will infer a stereotype based on that understanding.
3 - Explain what you understood in one sentence for each element: I have recognized the roles, attributes, and categorization of each element from UFO and its representation in OntoUML.
4 - Infer ONE possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype: Based on the characteristics and roles of each element, I will select one possible OntoUML stereotype that matches best. If no suitable stereotype is found, I will specify "None".

The output will be formatted as a CSV file with columns "name" and "inferred_stereotype", delimited by semicolons ( ; ):
