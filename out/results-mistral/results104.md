 PersonUnderECGMonitoring: LivingPerson (a kind representing individuals in a certain state)
float: Quantity (a measure of some amount)
HeartElectricalActivity: Event (an occurrence in time)
LivingPerson: Kind (a fundamental endurant type with uniform principles of individuation, identity, and persistence for its instances)
ECGLead: Relator (truth-maker of a material relation)
ECGSampleSequence: Process (series of steps or actions performed over time)
Measurement: Quality (particularized property understood as a value in a conceptual space)
Device: Kind (a fundamental endurant type representing an artifact, tool or system)
ECGRecordingSession: Event (an occurrence in time)
ECGLeadBipolarLimb: Role (sortal with contingent relational classification conditions)
TimeSeriesMeasurements: Quality (particularized property understood as a value in a conceptual space)
ElectricPotential: Mode (particularized property not conceived as a value in a conceptual space)
UnitOfMeasurement: Property (representing common properties of multiple kinds)
Sensor: Kind (a fundamental endurant type with uniform principles of individuation, identity, and persistence for its instances)
ECGDevice: Kind (a fundamental endurant type representing an artifact, tool or system)
Property: Non-sortal (rigidly defining essential properties for its instances)
BiologicalPerson: Kind (a kind representing a biological organism)
Task: RoleMixin (sortal with contingent relational classification conditions)
ECGLeadUnipolar: HistoricalRoleMixin (anti-rigid type defining contingent properties for its instances, may or may not remain in the role over time)
