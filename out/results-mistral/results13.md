 I understand the elements provided as different data items in an ontology. For each element with no specified stereotype, I will infer one possible OntoUML stereotype based on the information given and my knowledge of the UFO categories.

Here is a CSV representation of my interpretation for each element:

```
Name;Inferred_Stereotype
Billie Eilish;kind
The Moon;kind
John's weight;quantity
Event of composing a new song;event
```

Please note that I have provided the inferred stereotype for the elements with no specified stereotype. The elements "Billie Eilish," "The Moon," and "John's weight" have already been given stereotypes, so I did not provide a new stereotype for them. If an element has a missing stereotype and does not fit into any of the provided categories, I would say "None."
