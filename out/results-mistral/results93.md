 I understand the following elements as follows:
1. Transaction Phase: a phase or state in a transaction
2. Key: an identifier for data or objects
3. Artificial Object: an object created and manipulated by a system or program
4. Lifecycle Stage: a stage in the lifecycle of an entity
5. Block: a block of data in a blockchain
6. Data Object: an object that stores data
7. Business Artifact Type: a type of business-related item or concept
8. Agent: an actor that performs actions and has beliefs and desires
9. Fact: a statement or piece of information that is considered true
10. Transaction: the transfer of funds or assets between parties
11. State Variable: a variable that defines the current state of a system or contract
12. Transaction Trie: a Merkle trie data structure used in Ethereum blockchains to store key-value pairs
13. Business Artifact: a physical or abstract entity involved in business processes
14. Business Rule: a rule governing behavior within a business process
15. Human Agent: an agent that is human or has human-like characteristics
16. Event: something that happens or takes place
17. Off-chain Storage: storage located outside of the blockchain
18. Physical Object: a tangible, three-dimensional entity
19. Goal: an objective that an agent strives to achieve
20. Artificial Agent: an agent created and controlled by a system or program
21. Contract Storage: storage used for the contract data in smart contracts
22. State: the current condition or status of a system or object
23. Smart Contract: a self-executing digital contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code
24. Act: an action taken by an agent to achieve a goal
25. Payload: the data contained within a message, transaction, or block
26. Function: a piece of code that performs a specific task in a program
27. Value: a measure or quantity representing worth or utility
28. Blockchain: a distributed digital ledger enforced by multiple parties
29. External Actor: an actor that exists outside the system being modeled
30. Inter-organizational Process: a process spanning more than one organization
31. Service: a function provided by a system or program to other parts of the system or external actors
32. Initiator: the actor who starts a process or action
33. Executor: the actor who performs an action within a process
34. Process Participant: any actor involved in a process, including initiators and executors
35. Process Contract: a contract used to govern the behavior of a process
36. Account Wallet: a digital wallet associated with a blockchain account
37. Business Object: an object related to business activities or transactions

Based on my understanding, I have inferred the following possible OntoUML stereotypes for elements that do not have one listed:
Transaction Phase - [Phase]
Artificial Object - [Artificial Object]
Block - [Event]
Data Object - [Data Object]
State Variable - [None] (It doesn't seem to have a corresponding OntoUML stereotype)
Transaction Trie - [None] (It doesn't seem to have a corresponding OntoUML stereotype)
Process - [Process]
Account Wallet - [None] (It doesns't seem to have a corresponding OntoUML stereotype, but I would suggest [Off-chain Storage])
Business Object - [Business Artifact]

The CSV output will be:
