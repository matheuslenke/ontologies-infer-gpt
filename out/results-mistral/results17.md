 Inferred stereotypes:
1. biological_event - Event
2. Entity_in_process, degraded_entity - None (As no clear stereotype could be inferred from provided names)
3. pathway - Process
4. output - Quality or Mode (Without context, it is not possible to definitively assign a single stereotype. However, 'output' suggests a property that may belong to the Quality category or might be conceived as a Value in a conceptual space, aligning with the Mode stereotype.)
5. active_entity - Endurant type (The term 'active' implies existence across time and could refer to an endurant)
6. process - Process
7. string - None (As no clear stereotype could be inferred from the provided name 'string')
8. regulator - Role (Roles often involve some sort of regulation or influence within a system)
9. participation_in_biological_event, input - Relator (Both terms seem to denote relations between entities in a biological event)
10. role_in_biological_event - Role (A role refers to the function or position that an entity plays in a specific context.)
11. biological_entity - Endurant type
12. int - None (As no clear stereotype could be inferred from the provided name 'int')
