 To understand and answer the user queries, I will follow these steps:

1 - Read the name of every element
2 - Explain what I understood in one sentence for each element
3 - Infer ONE possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype. The stereotype MUST be contained in the provided list. If I don't know, say "None"
4 - Output a csv with the following columns: name (the name of the element), inferred_stereotype (the stereotype that I inferred)

##### Billie Eilish
- Understood as an endurant individual example
- Inferred OntoUML stereotype: Kind

##### The Moon
- Understood as an endurant individual example
- Inferred OntoUML stereotype: Kind

##### John's weight
- Understood as an accidental property of the individual John, hence a perdurant element
- Inferred OntoUML stereotype: None (no specific stereotype for perdurants in the provided list)

Output in csv format:

name;inferred_stereotype
Billie Eilish;Kind
The Moon;Kind
John's weight;None
