Prompt items: 
Electricity Source, Robot, Being Lifted, Robot Handle, Battery, Object Lifter, Electricity Consumer, BalanceSupport, LiftUp, Being Supported, Electricity Consumption, Patient, Balance Supporter, 
amout of items: 13
 I understand the elements as follows:
1. Electricity Source: A type of Quantity or Energy that provides electrical power
2. Robot: A kind or Collective entity made up of numerous parts
3. Being Lifted: A Situation, Event, or Process in which an object is being raised off the ground
4. Robot Handle: A Part or Role of the robot, likely serving as a means to manipulate objects
5. Battery: A Quantity or Quality related to electrical energy storage
6. Object Lifter: A type of Role or HistoricalRole of the robot, specifically related to lifting objects
7. Electricity Consumer: An individual consuming electricity for some function
8. BalanceSupport: A Situation, Event, or Process in which balance is being supported or maintained
9. LiftUp: An Event or Process involving an object or the action of being lifted
10. Being Supported: A Role or HistoricalRole in which an object is receiving support from another entity
11. Electricity Consumption: An Event, Situation, or Process related to the use of electrical energy by a consumer
12. Patient: A type of individual requiring medical attention or treatment (assuming this is part of the domain being modeled)
13. Balance Supporter: A Role or HistoricalRole in which an entity provides balance support, either structurally or functionally

Inferred OntoUML stereotypes for each element are as follows:
- Electricity Source: Quantity
- Robot: Kind
- Being Lifted: Event
- Robot Handle: Role
- Battery: Quality
- Object Lifter: HistoricalRole
- Electricity Consumer: None (This term doesn't have a predefined OntoUML stereotype, but could be considered a role or historical role)
- BalanceSupport: Situation
- LiftUp: Process
- Being Supported: Role
- Electricity Consumption: Event
- Patient: None (Assuming this term doesn't have a predefined OntoUML stereotype, but could be considered a type or kind)
- Balance Supporter: HistoricalRole
