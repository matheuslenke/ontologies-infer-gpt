 I understand the elements as follows:
1. Variant: A kind or specialization of kinds (possibly a sortal), not specified as a specific stereotype.
2. VariationReg: A possible quantity, quality, mode, or property, not specified as a specific stereotype.
3. Module_Phase: A phase with contingent intrinsic classification conditions, possibly a sortal (phase stereotype).
4. Element: An endurant individual in UFO, not specified as a specific stereotype.
5. Deg_Reg: A kind of regulation, possibly an event or process stereotype.
6. SubPhase: A phase within another phase, possibly a role or phase stereotype.
7. DegreeRegulation: A quantitative aspect related to a regulation, possibly a quantity stereotype.
8. Var_Reg: A quality or property associated with a regulation, possibly a quality or mode stereotype.
9. UpperPhase: A superordinate phase or phase category, possibly a kind or subkind stereotype.
10. Regulation: A particularized property understood as a value in a conceptual space, possibly a relator or quality stereotype.
11. PhaseWithModule: A contingent relational classification condition involving a module, possibly a role stereotype.
12. Degree: An individual instance of a quantity type (possibly a quantity stereotype).
13. Subject: A participant in some sortal relation or event, not specified as a specific stereotype.
14. Element_Module: A relationship between an endurant element and a module, not specified as a specific stereotype.
15. Module: A perdurant individual or process, possibly an event or process stereotype.
16. Phase: A sortal with contingent intrinsic classification conditions, possibly a phase stereotype.
17. Sub_Phase: A subordinate phase within another phase, possibly a role or phase stereotype.

Inferred OntoUML stereotypes for each missing element:
Element;Kind (as it's an endurant individual)
VariationReg;Quality (as it's associated with some kind of property)
Deg_Reg;Event (since it's a kind of regulation)
Subject;None (As no specific stereotype was given, it might be a sub-class of kind or another sortal type)
Element_Module;Association (as it represents a relationship between elements)
Module;Process (Since it could be a perpetual or enduring phenomenon)
