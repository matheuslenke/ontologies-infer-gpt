 I understood that "Quality" is a sortal in UFO, representing particularized properties not conceived as a value in a conceptual space. Since it doesn't have an explicitly given OntoUML stereotype and all the provided stereotypes are from the list, I will infer that it corresponds to the "Quality" stereotype.

Here is the output:

name; inferred_stereotype
"Value"; Quality
"Universal"; None
"Gradable NFR"; None
"Intention"; None
"Softgoal"; None
"Vague NFR"; None
"Quality Region"; None
"Gradable Quality Region"; None
"Crisp Quality Region"; None
"Quality Constraint"; None
"Function"; None
"Goal"; None
"Hardgoal"; None
"Quality Structure"; None
"NFR (Quality Goal)"; None
"Functional Requirement"; None
