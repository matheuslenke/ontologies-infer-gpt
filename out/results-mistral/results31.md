amout of items: 29
 Element | Inferred_Stereotype
--- | ---
Migration | event
LithologicUnit qua shale | type (since 'qua' indicates the quality of a specific type)
Trap | historicalRoleMixin (assuming it's a historic state of some kind)
Generation | process (assuming it's a continuous or recurring change)
Porosity | quality
Granulometry | mode (since it's not a value in a conceptual space)
Structure | structuralRole (structural roles are contingent relational classification conditions)
Value | quality
Lithological unit | type
BoundaryType | mixin (as properties might be essential to some instances and accidental to others)
Pre-generation | phaseMixin (assuming it's a state before the generation process)
Oil + Trap | collective (since it groups two elements, 'Oil' and 'Trap', which fulfill similar roles)
Oil + Mudstone + Porous Rock | category (defining essential properties for its instances)
Acumulation | historicalRole (assuming it's a historic state of some accumulated resource)
Dimensions | mixin (as properties might be essential to some instances and accidental to others)
Oil + Porous rock | type (since '+'' indicates aggregation or composition)
Reservoir | situation (since it denotes a context, location, or spatial setting)
Sandstone | sortal with contingent intrinsic classification conditions (phase stereotype could be considered, but sandstone is an endurant not an event)
Hidrocarbon | quantity (quantities are portions of matter)
Boundary | relator (since it's the truth-maker of a material relation)
LithologicUnit qua sandstone | type (since 'qua' indicates the quality of a specific type, and 'sandstone' is also a type)
Siliciclastic Rock | type (generic category for rock types formed from silica and clastics)
Seal | barrier or relator (seals could be barriers preventing something from entering or leaving, but they might also function as the truth-maker of a material relation)
Shale | endurant type (shale is an example of an endurant in the UFO ontology)
Oil | quality (oil is a particularized property understood as a value in a conceptual space)
Quantity Organic matter | quantity (quantities are portions of matter)
Rock | category (defining essential properties for its instances)
contact | role (since it's a contingent relational classification condition)
Source Rock | category (defining essential properties for its instances)
