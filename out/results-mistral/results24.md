 Understood. I will infer the OntoUML stereotype for each element in the given list and output the result as a CSV.

For the given list: ["Oher_Variables", "Air_Relative_Humidity", "Degrees_Celsius", "Crop", "Geolocation", "Accumulated_Precipitation", "Production_Evolution_States", "Climate_Station", "Maximum_Temperature", "Leaf_Wetting_Duration", "Satellite_Images", "Minimum_Temperature", "Digital_Images", "TIFF", "NDVI_Index", "Milimeters", "Hours/day", "Percentage"]

The inferred OntoUML stereotype for each element is as follows:

"Oher_Variables", None, Category
"Air_Relative_Humidity", None, Quality
"Degrees_Celsius", None, Quality
"Crop", None, None (No stereotype provided for this type in the list)
"Geolocation", None, Phase-mixin
"Accumulated_Precipitation", None, Quantity
"Production_Evolution_States", None, Role
"Climate_Station", None, Event
"Maximum_Temperature", None, Quality
"Leaf_Wetting_Duration", None, Mode
"Satellite_Images", None, Digital_Image
"Minimum_Temperature", None, Quality
"Digital_Images", None, Digital_Image
"TIFF", None, Event (Assuming it refers to the "event" of having TIFF files)
"NDVI_Index", None, Phase-mixin
"Milimeters", None, Quantity
"Hours/day", None, Quality
"Percentage", None, Quality

CSV Output:
