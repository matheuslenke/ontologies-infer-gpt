 I have read the following elements: Billie Eilish, Moon, John's weight, composing a new song.

1. Billie Eilish - Endurant individual (kind) representing a person
2. Moon - Endurant individual (kind or collectively regarded as kind) representing a celestial body
3. John's weight - Perdurant individual (quality or mode) representing an accidental property of a person
4. composing a new song - Perdurant individual (event or process) representing an occurrence in time with contingent relational classification conditions.

Inferring one possible OntoUML stereotype for each element without knowing their exact OntoUML category:

1. Billie Eilish - kind
2. Moon - kind or category (if collectively regarded as kind)
3. John's weight - quality or mode
4. composing a new song - event or process

The resulting CSV would be:
