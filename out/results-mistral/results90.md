 Understood. Here are the inferred stereotypes for the elements based on the OntoUML class stereotype list provided:

* boolean: None (It doesn't fit into any of the provided OntoUML stereotypes)
* Address: None (It doesn't fit into any of the provided OntoUML stereotypes, but it can be modeled as a mixin type with other stereotypes such as Location or AddressableEntity)
* PrescribedDoseSchedule: Event (As it represents a specific occurrence in time related to the prescription of a dose schedule)
* PatientReport: Report (A patient-generated report is a particular type of report, hence it can be modeled as the Report stereotype)
* Drug: Subkind (Since it's a specialized version of a kind - chemical substance or medication)
* ContactPoint: Role (As it represents roles associated with contact information such as email or phone number)
* DiagnosticProcedure: MedicalProcedure (A diagnostic procedure is a specific medical procedure performed to evaluate or diagnose a medical condition)
* MedicalHistory: Category (It defines essential properties for instances - the patient's past medical history)
* Diagnosis: Kind (As it represents the fundamental category of disease or health disorder)
* Doctor: Person (Since it represents individual humans, and Person is one of the stereotypes provided in OntoUML)
* NonSevereOutcome, PrescribedDrug, SevereSymptom, SpecialistDoctor, MildSymptom, NamedEntity, SurgicalProcedure, MedicalProcedureTrigger: None (It's not possible to assign a stereotype based on the given information)
* MedicalSpeciality: Category (As it defines essential properties for instances - the medical specialty of a doctor or practitioner)
* PhysicalExam: Situation (It represents a specific context or circumstance in which an examination is performed)
* PalliativeProcedure: MedicalProcedure (Since it's a specific type of medical procedure aimed at improving the quality of life of patients)
* Date: Kind (As it's the fundamental category representing a particular day and time)
* PreviousIllness: Category (It defines essential properties for instances - past illnesses or health conditions of a patient)
* SymptomEnum: Kind (Since it represents a fundamental category of symptoms, as enumerations can be modeled as kinds in OntoUML)
* DiagnosisMethod: Category (As it defines essential properties for instances - the method used to make a diagnosis)
* TherapeuticProcedure: MedicalProcedure (A therapeutic procedure is a medical intervention designed to treat a medical condition or relieve its symptoms)
* MedicalCondition: Kind (As it represents the fundamental category of health disorders, diseases or conditions)
* MedicalConditionStage: Category (Since it defines essential properties for instances - the stage of a medical condition in a patient's history)
* SpecialistMedicalProcedure: Process (It represents a process involving multiple steps and activities related to a specialist medical procedure)
* string: None (Since there is no stereotype in OntoUML that directly corresponds to string data types)
* float: None (As there is no OntoUML stereotype that directly corresponds to floating-point numbers or decimals)
* Rating: Quality (Since ratings provide a value within a conceptual space, and the Quality stereotype represents particularized properties understood as a value in a conceptual space)
* Patient, Symptom, ReportingPatient, HoursSpecification, Person, DoseSchedule, SevereOutcome, MedicalProcedureOutcome, PresenceMedicalProcedure, VisitRequest, RemoteMedicalProcedure, MedicalProcedure, User: None (It's not possible to assign a stereotype based on the given information)
* TreatmentPatient: Patient (Since it refers to a specific patient who undergoes treatment, and Patient is one of the OntoUML stereotypes provided in the list)
