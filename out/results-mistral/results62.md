 Based on the provided information:
Human Capability: A human ability or skill that can be performed (Capability in OntoUML)
Physical Agent: An entity with a body that can interact physically with the world (None. It does not have a standard stereotype in OntoUML provided)
Capability Context: The specific circumstances under which a capability is exercised or performed (Phase in OntoUML)
Human Aspect Phase: A specific stage of human development or life (Same as Human Aspect Type, which can be inferred as Phase in OntoUML)
Object: An entity that can be perceived by the senses and can occupy space for some time (Artifact in OntoUML)
Artifact: An object that is man-made or manufactured to be within an artifactual class (Same as Object, which can be inferred as Artifact in OntoUML)
Task: An activity with a defined objective or purpose (Event in OntoUML)
Person: An individual human being (Same as Human Agent or Individual in UFO, but not explicitly provided stereotypes in OntoUML)
Competence Outcome: The result of the successful execution of a competence (Outcome in OntoUML)
Competence Type: A classification of competence based on its nature or field (Category or type in OntoUML, depending on the specific case)
Disposition: A stable and relatively permanent feature that influences behavior (Mixin in OntoUML)
Competence Context: The specific circumstances under which a competence is exercised or performed (Context in OntoUML can be a suitable alternative if not explicitly Phase)
Human Characteristic: A feature, attribute, or quality associated with being human (Non-sortal in UFO, but not explicitly provided stereotypes in OntoUML)
Personal Competence: A competence that is inherent to an individual person (Competence in OntoUML)
Task Type: A specific kind of task (None. It does not have a standard stereotype in OntoUML provided)
Social Capability: The ability of individuals to interact effectively within a social context (Social Capability in OntoUML)
Agent: An entity that can perform actions or cause things to happen (Same as Physical Agent or Individual, but not explicitly provided stereotypes in OntoUML)
Capability Manifestation: A manifested form of the capability (None. It does not have a standard stereotype in OntoUML provided)
Human Capability Type: The classification of a human capability based on its nature or field (Same as Capability in OntoUML)
Capability-requiring Role: The role that requires a particular capability to be performed effectively (Role or Historical Role in OntoUML, depending on the specific case)
Skill: A learned ability or competence to perform an activity (Capability or Competence in OntoUML, depending on the specific case)
Social Agent: An entity that interacts within a social context (Same as Agent)
Artifact Type: The class or category of an artifact (None. It does not have a standard stereotype in OntoUML provided)
Skill Type: A classification of skills based on their nature or field (Category or type in OntoUML, depending on the specific case)
Attitude: An enduring positive or negative disposition toward something (Mode in OntoUML)
Human Aspect Type: A characteristic or feature associated with being human (Same as Human Characteristic)
Knowledge: Familiarity, awareness, or understanding of something (Quality in OntoUML)
Capability Outcome: The result of the successful execution of a capability (Outcome in OntoUML)
Human Aspect: A characteristic or feature associated with being human (Same as Human Characteristic)
Capability: An ability to act or perform (Same as Competence, Human Capability or Physical Agent's competency)
