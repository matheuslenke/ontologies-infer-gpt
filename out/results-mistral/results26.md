The missing stereotypes to infer are:
- Hired Brokerage: brokerage (not explicitly stated but can be implied from the name)
- Buyer: none (the term itself indicates a role without an explicit stereotype in OntoUML)
- StockholderOrganization: Organization, Category or RoleMixin (given its role as an instance of an Organization that fulfills a certain role with regards to stocks, RoleMixin might be more appropriate, but Category is also possible since it defines essential properties for its instances)
- Public Traded Company: Quantity, Kind, Subkind or Type (given its nature as a portion of matter, Quantity seems plausible; however, it can also be seen as a kind of Organization or a specialization of a type of Organization)
- Person: Individual (not explicitly stated but can be implied from the name)
- StockHolder: RoleMixin (since stockholders are individuals that hold stocks, but their essential nature is not the holding, but rather the individual being involved in some way with the company or financial instrument)
- Contract: Relator (it seems to be the truth-maker of a material relation between two parties)
