 I have read the names of the elements: Plane, Plane Ticket, Boat, International Destination, Driving License, Ticket, Hotel Reservation, Boat Ticket, National Tourist, International Tourist, Departure Place, Destination, Train Ticket, Arrival Place, string, Date, Legal Authorization, Transportation Mean, Person, Driver, National Destination, Passenger, Reservation, Train, Bus, int, Accommodation, Costumer, Trip, International Trip, Car, National Trip, Airbnb, Hotel Room, Tourist, Arrival Date, Adult, Child, Departure Date, Origin, Bus Ticket, Airbnb Reservation, Route, Travel Investment.

I understand that Plane and Train are Transportation Means; Boat, Car, Bus are also Transportation Means but require "int" for their stereotypes to be specified further. Plane Ticket, Bus Ticket, Boat Ticket, Train Ticket are types of Tickets. International Destination, National Destination, Origin, and Route are related to locations or directions. Driving License is Legal Authorization for a specific type of vehicle (Driver). Hotel Reservation, Airbnb Reservation are types of Reservations for Accommodation. Plane, Train, Bus, Car, Boat, Adult, Child are individuals or entities (Person). International Trip, National Trip, and Travel Investment are Types of Trips. Hotel Room, Airbnb are specific kinds of Accommodation. Tourist is a person traveling and could be either National or International. Date, Departure Date, Arrival Date could be phases with contingent classification conditions (Phase or phase-mixin). Ticket, Reservation might be instances of Kind (or Subkind for ticket types specific to each Transportation Mean). The remaining elements, string, Person, and Costumer, require further context to infer their OntoUML stereotypes.
