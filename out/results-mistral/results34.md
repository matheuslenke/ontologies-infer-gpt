 Goal: This could be considered as an event or situation, depending on whether it involves a specific outcome. Inferred stereotype: event

Business Requirements Specification: This is likely a document or artifact that outlines the business needs for a system or project. Inferred stereotype: Artifact

Agent: An agent can be either an endurant (an individual) or a perdurant (an action or process). It could also be considered as a role, but without specific roles given, it's hard to determine the exact stereotype. Inferred stereotype: Endurant (if an individual) or Role (if more context is available)

(External Business Regulations): This seems like a type of normative description that outlines rules and regulations affecting external business activities. Inferred stereotype: Normative Description

System Requirement: This is a specification of what the system should do or achieve, often detailed in a document or artifact. Inferred stereotype: Artifact

Event: This describes a specific happening or occurrence that unfolds in time. Inferred stereotype: Event

Program Specification: This is a detailed description of how a program is supposed to behave or function. Inferred stereotype: Artifact

Loaded Program Copy: This is a specific instance of a program, loaded onto a machine or system for execution. Inferred stereotype: Program

Artifact: As mentioned above, an artifact is any physical or conceptual entity that is produced or used by people, such as a document or a software application. Inferred stereotype: Artifact

Organization: An organization can be seen as an endurant type, as it exists with all its parts over time, possessing essential and accidental properties. However, without more context, it's hard to determine if it should be considered as a substantial or moment type, kind or subkind. Inferred stereotype: Endurant (if an individual) or Kind (if more context is available)

Normative Description: This defines rules, regulations, or standards that apply to certain types of entities. Inferred stereotype: Normative Description

System Requirements Specification: Similar to a business requirement specification, this document outlines the technical needs for a system or project. Inferred stereotype: Artifact

System Component: A component of a larger system. It could be seen as an endurant (if it's a part of the system that exists with all its parts over time) or a perdurant (if it's a process or action within the system). Inferred stereotype: Endurant (if an individual part) or Role (if more context is available)

Machine Assumption: This is likely an assumption made about a machine or system when designing or using it. Inferred stereotype: None

Program, SubSystem: These are software applications or components within a larger software system. They could be seen as endurants (as they exist with all their parts over time) or perdurants (if they involve actions or processes). Inferred stereotype: Program (if a software application) or Endurant (if an individual part of a larger program or subsystem, if more context is available)

(Internal) Business Rule: This is a rule or regulation that applies internally to a business organization. Inferred stereotype: None

World Assumption: Similar to a machine assumption, this is an assumption made about the world in general when designing or using a system or project. Inferred stereotype: None

Business Constraint: This is a restriction on what can be done within a business context. Inferred stereotype: None

Machine: This could be seen as either an endurant (a physical machine that exists with all its parts over time) or a perdurant (if it involves actions or processes). Without more context, it's hard to determine the exact stereotype. Inferred stereotype: Endurant (if a physical machine) or Role (if more context is available)

Program Copy Execution: This is likely an event that involves the execution of a program copy on a machine or system. Inferred stereotype: Event

Proposition: A proposition expresses some state of affairs or relationship between entities. Inferred stereotype: Proposition

Software System: A software system can be seen as a perdurant, as it unfolds over time and accumulates temporal parts. It could also be considered as an endurant, if its components are considered together as a single entity. However, without more context, it's hard to determine the exact stereotype. Inferred stereotype: Perdurant (if focusing on the actions or processes within the system) or Endurant (if considering the software system as a whole as a single entity, if more context is available)

System Element: This is a component of a larger software system. It could be seen as an endurant (as it exists with all its parts over time) or a perdurant (if it involves actions or processes). Inferred stereotype: Endurant (if an individual part) or Role (if more context is available)

System Requirements Specification: As mentioned above, this document outlines the technical needs for a system or project. Inferred stereotype: Artifact

System Element: As mentioned above, this is a component of a larger software system. Inferred stereotype: Endurant (if an individual part) or Role (if more context is available)
