},
{
"name": "Etc",
"inferred_stereotype": "type",

{
"name": "Entity",
"inferred_stereotype": "type",
"explanation": "In the context of digital games, 'Entity' is a very general term referring to any distinct object, character, or element within the game world. Due to its broad nature, it's best categorized as a 'type' without specifying a more specific ontological nature."

    Etc: type
    Game: kind
    Goal: kind
    Object: kind
    Scenario: kind
    Entity: kind
    Player: kind
    Encounter: kind
    Location: kind

    Session: kind
    Equipment: kind
    Consumable: subkind
    Match: kind
    Character: kind
