"name": "Model",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "Model is a subkind of 'Information Item' that represents a simplified representation of a system or concept. It is a specific type of information used for understanding, analysis, or communication. Examples: A UML diagram of a software system, a mathematical model of a physical phenomenon."
},
{
"name": "Software Item",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "Software Item is a subkind of 'Information Item' that represents information specifically related to software. It encompasses various forms of software-related content. Examples: The content of a source code file, the data structures used in a program."
},
{
"name": "Document",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "Document is a subkind of 'Information Item' that represents a human-readable record of information. It is a specific type of information intended for communication or storage. Examples: A text file, a PDF document."
},
{
"name": "Source Code",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "Source Code is a subkind of 'Code' that represents human-readable instructions written in a programming language. It is a specific type of code that is later translated into machine-executable form. Examples: A Python script, a Java class definition."
},
{
"name": "Machine Code",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "Machine Code is a subkind of 'Code' that represents instructions in a form that a computer can directly execute. It is the lowest-level representation of a program. Examples: A sequence of binary instructions, assembly language instructions."
},
{
"name": "Composite Artifact",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "Composite Artifact represents a specialization of 'Artifact' that denotes artifacts composed of multiple parts or components. It contrasts with 'Simple Artifact' and signifies artifacts with internal structure. Examples: A software system consisting of multiple modules, a book series comprising several volumes."
