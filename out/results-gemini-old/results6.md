3 - Providing the explanation for each stereotype inferred:

- DeclaredProvenance: Represents a fundamental type of provenance information, thus classified as a kind.
- Provider: Represents a role that someone or something can play in a transaction or process.
- Consumer: Represents a role that someone or something can play in a transaction or process.
- DeclaredValue: Represents a fundamental type of value that can be declared, thus classified as a kind.
- ConsumerNeed: Represents a fundamental concept of a need that a consumer has, thus classified as a kind.
- Payment: Represents a fundamental concept of a financial transaction, thus classified as a kind.
- Receipt: Represents a fundamental document that acknowledges a transaction, thus classified as a kind.
- Production: Represents a fundamental process of creating or manufacturing something, thus classified as a kind.
- RawProduct: Represents a fundamental type of product that is unprocessed or minimally processed, thus classified as a kind.
- CounterObject: Represents a fundamental concept of an object that can be counted or quantified, thus classified as a kind.
- ProvenanceEvaluation: Represents a fundamental process of assessing or analyzing provenance information, thus classified as a kind.
- Purchase: Represents a fundamental type of transaction involving the buying of something, thus classified as a kind.
- Policy: Represents a fundamental set of rules or guidelines, thus classified as a kind.
- Provenance: Represents a fundamental concept of the origin or history of something, thus classified as a kind.
- ValueObject: Represents a common characteristic of objects that hold value. It is not restricted to a specific type of value, thus classified as a category.
- GeographicIndication: Represents a fundamental type of indication that identifies the geographical origin of a product, thus classified as a kind.
- Sale: Represents a fundamental type of transaction involving the selling of something, thus classified as a kind.
- Actor: Represents a role that someone or something can play in an activity or event.
- ValueActivity: Represents a fundamental type of activity that involves or influences value, thus classified as a kind.
- Agent: Represents a role of something or someone that acts or has the power to act.
