1 - Reading the name of every element: 
participation_in_biological_event, pathway, output, role_in_biological_event, biological_entity, degraded_entity, process, biological_event, event, Entity_in_process, active_entity, int, regulator, string.

2 - Inferring ONE possible OntoUML stereotype for each element:
- participation_in_biological_event: **relator**
- pathway: **subkind**
- output: **role**
- role_in_biological_event: **role**
- biological_entity: **kind**
- degraded_entity: **phase**
- process: **subkind**
- biological_event: **subkind**
- event: **kind**
- Entity_in_process: **role** 
- active_entity: **phase**
- int: **type**
- regulator: **role**
- string: **type**

3 - Providing the explanation for each stereotype inferred:
- **participation_in_biological_event:** Represents the relation, and possibly some properties, between a role and an event, therefore it is a **relator**.
- **pathway:** Represents a specific type of biological entity, therefore it is a **subkind**.
- **output:** Represents the role something plays in an event, in this case, being the output of a biological process, therefore it is a **role**.
- **role_in_biological_event:** Represents a specific type of role in a biological event, therefore it is a **role**.
- **biological_entity:** Represents a fundamental type of thing, therefore it is a **kind**.
- **degraded_entity:** Represents a contingent phase of a biological entity, therefore it is a **phase**.
- **process:** Represents a specific type of entity that unfolds in time, therefore it is a **subkind** of **perdurant**.
- **biological_event:** Represents a more specific type of event, therefore it is a **subkind**.
- **event:** Represents a fundamental type of perdurant, therefore it is a **kind**.
- **Entity_in_process:** Represents the role something has in a process, therefore it is a **role**.
- **active_entity:** Represents a contingent phase of an entity, therefore it is a **phase**.
- **int:** Represents the primitive type integer, therefore it is a **type**.
- **regulator:** Represents the role of regulating something, therefore it is a **role**.
- **string:** Represents the primitive type string, therefore it is a **type**.
