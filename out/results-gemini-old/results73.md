1 - Read the name of every element:
Quality Constraint, Quality Structure, Intention, Gradable NFR, Crisp Quality Region, Goal, Situation, Hardgoal, Vague NFR, Quality Universal, Quality, Function, Functional Requirement, Quality Value, Quality Region, NFR (Quality Goal), Softgoal, Gradable Quality Region

2 - Infer ONE possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype:
    - Quality Constraint: **Subkind**
    - Quality Structure: **Kind**
    - Intention: **Subkind** 
    - Gradable NFR: **Subkind**
    - Crisp Quality Region: **Subkind**
    - Goal: **Kind**
    - Situation: **Kind** 
    - Hardgoal: **Subkind** 
    - Vague NFR: **Subkind** 
    - Quality Universal: **Kind**
    - Quality: **Kind** 
    - Function: **Kind**
    - Functional Requirement: **Subkind** 
    - Quality Value: **Subkind**
    - Quality Region: **Kind** 
    - NFR (Quality Goal): **Subkind** 
    - Softgoal: **Subkind**
    - Gradable Quality Region:  **Subkind**


3 - Provide the explanation for each stereotypes inferred:

    - **Quality Constraint: Subkind** of Quality Structure. It represents a specific type of Quality Structure that imposes limitations or boundaries on quality aspects.
    - **Quality Structure: Kind**. Represents a fundamental concept related to the organization or framework of quality attributes.
    - **Intention: Subkind** of Goal, representing a specific type of goal.
    - **Gradable NFR: Subkind** of NFR (Quality Goal). Represents a Non-Functional Requirement that can be measured or evaluated on a scale.
    - **Crisp Quality Region: Subkind** of Quality Region. Represents a specific and well-defined range or area within a Quality Region.
    - **Goal: Kind**. A fundamental concept representing an objective.
    - **Situation: Kind**. A fundamental concept, representing a set of circumstances.
    - **Hardgoal: Subkind** of Goal, representing a specific type of goal characterized by its strict nature.
    - **Vague NFR: Subkind** of NFR (Quality Goal). Represents a Non-Functional Requirement that is not clearly defined.
    - **Quality Universal: Kind**. Represents a fundamental concept or principle related to quality.
    - **Quality: Kind**. A fundamental concept.
    - **Function: Kind**. A fundamental concept.
    - **Functional Requirement: Subkind** of Function. Represents a specific type of function.
    - **Quality Value: Subkind** of Quality. Represents a specific value or level.
    - **Quality Region: Kind**. Represents a fundamental concept related to a range or area within a quality attribute. 
    - **NFR (Quality Goal): Subkind** of Quality Goal, representing a goal related to non-functional aspects.
    - **Softgoal: Subkind** of Goal, representing a non-critical or aspirational objective.
    - **Gradable Quality Region: Subkind** of Quality Region. Represents a Quality Region that can be measured.
