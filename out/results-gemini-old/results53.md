1 - Reading the name of every element:
RefSeq
Record
Gene
Insertion
Allelic Variant
Alelle
Nucleotide
Allelic Reference
Inserted Nucleotide
Chromosome

2 - Inferring ONE possible OntoUML stereotype for each element:
RefSeq: kind
Record: mixin
Gene: kind
Insertion: kind
Allelic Variant: subkind
Alelle: kind
Nucleotide: kind
Allelic Reference: subkind
Inserted Nucleotide: subkind
Chromosome: kind

3 - Providing the explanation for each stereotype inferred:
RefSeq: A fundamental sort of endurant type. RefSeq is a database of publicly available nucleotide sequences and their protein products.
Record: Represents common properties of individuals of multiple Kinds. A record can be of a gene, nucleotide, etc.
Gene: A fundamental sort of endurant type. A gene is a basic unit of heredity and a sequence of nucleotides in DNA or RNA.
Insertion: A fundamental sort of endurant type. An insertion is a type of mutation that involves the addition of genetic material.
Allelic Variant: A rigid specialization of a kind. An allelic variant is a specific version of a gene.
Alelle: A fundamental sort of endurant type. An allele is one of two or more alternative forms of a gene.
Nucleotide: A fundamental sort of endurant type. A nucleotide is a basic building block of DNA or RNA.
Allelic Reference: A rigid specialization of a kind. An allelic reference is a specific version of an allele.
Inserted Nucleotide: A rigid specialization of a kind. An inserted nucleotide is a specific type of nucleotide that has been added to a DNA sequence.
Chromosome: A fundamental sort of endurant type. A chromosome is a thread-like structure found in the nucleus of most living cells, carrying genetic information in the form of genes.
