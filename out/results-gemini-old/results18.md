2 - Inferring stereotypes:
Module - kind
UpperPhase - phase
Degree - kind
Regulation - kind
Subject - kind
Deg_Reg - relator
DegreeRegulation - relator
Element_Module - relator
Variant - kind
Phase - phase
Element - kind
PhaseWithModule - relator
SubPhase - phase
Sub_Phase - phase
Var_Reg - relator
VariationReg - relator
Module_Phase - relator

3 - Explaining stereotypes:
Module - Represents a fundamental type of entity.
UpperPhase - Represents a phase of something, in this case, probably a phase of a module.
Degree - Represents a fundamental type of entity.
Regulation - Represents a fundamental type of entity.
Subject - Represents a fundamental type of entity, could be a person or an area of study.
Deg_Reg - Represents a relator connecting Degree and Regulation.
DegreeRegulation - Represents a relator, likely similar or equivalent to Deg_Reg.
Element_Module - Represents a relator connecting Element and Module.
Variant - Represents a fundamental type of entity, likely a variation of something else.
Phase - Represents a stage in a process or lifecycle.
Element - Represents a fundamental type of entity.
PhaseWithModule - Represents a relator connecting a Phase and a Module.
SubPhase - Represents a phase that is a part of a larger phase.
Sub_Phase - Represents a phase that is a part of a larger phase.
Var_Reg - Represents a relator connecting Variant and Regulation.
VariationReg - Represents a relator, likely similar or equivalent to Var_Reg.
Module_Phase - Represents a relator connecting Module and Phase.
