1 - Read the name of every element:
Recommendation Version
Recommendation
Concept Definition
Concept Defining Recommendation
Publication
Indirectly Recommendation Referencing Recomendation
int
Referenced Concept
Correct Concept
Indirectly Recommendation Referenced Recomendation
Recommendation Referencing Recomendation
Problematic Concetp
char
Concept
Possibly Problematic Recommendation
Problematic Recommendation
Concept Referencing Recommendation
Recommendation Referenced Recomendation

2 - Infer ONE possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype:
Recommendation Version: phase
Recommendation: kind
Concept Definition: kind
Concept Defining Recommendation: relator
Publication: kind
Indirectly Recommendation Referencing Recomendation: relator
int: type
Referenced Concept: role
Correct Concept: role
Indirectly Recommendation Referenced Recomendation: relator
Recommendation Referencing Recomendation: relator
Problematic Concetp: role
char: type
Concept: kind
Possibly Problematic Recommendation: role
Problematic Recommendation: role
Concept Referencing Recommendation: relator
Recommendation Referenced Recomendation: relator

3 - Provide the explanation for each stereotype inferred:
Recommendation Version: It represents a phase in the life cycle of a Recommendation.
Recommendation: Represents a type of thing that can be recommended.
Concept Definition: Represents a type of thing that defines a concept.
Concept Defining Recommendation: Represents a relationship between a concept definition and a recommendation.
Publication: Represents a type of thing that is published, like a research paper.
Indirectly Recommendation Referencing Recomendation: Represents an indirect relationship between two recommendations that reference the same recommendation.
int: It is a primitive type representing integer numbers.
Referenced Concept: Represents a role that a concept can play in a recommendation.
Correct Concept: Represents a role that a concept can play in a recommendation.
Indirectly Recommendation Referenced Recomendation: Represents an indirect relationship between two recommendations that reference the same recommendation.
Recommendation Referencing Recomendation: Represents a relationship between two recommendations where one references the other.
Problematic Concetp: Represents a role that a concept can play in a recommendation.
char: It is a primitive type representing characters.
Concept: Represents a type of thing that can be a concept.
Possibly Problematic Recommendation: Represents a role that a recommendation can play.
Problematic Recommendation: Represents a role that a recommendation can play.
Concept Referencing Recommendation: Represents a relationship between a concept and a recommendation, where the concept references the recommendation.
Recommendation Referenced Recomendation: Represents a relationship between two recommendations where one is referenced by the other.
