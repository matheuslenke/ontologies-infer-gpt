1 - Read the name of every element: 
transformation-duality, trading-partner, give, to, economic-event, participation, increment-event, inside-party, transformation, economic-agent, economic-resource, stock-flow, decrement-event, outflow, inflow, transfer, take, duality, transfer-duality, produce, outside-party, consume, from.

2 - Infer ONE possible OntoUML stereotype for each element with a missing stereotype:
transformation-duality: **relator**
trading-partner: **role**
give: **???** 
to: **???**
economic-event: **event**
participation: **???**
increment-event: **phase**
inside-party: **role**
transformation: **event**
economic-agent: **kind**
economic-resource: **kind**
stock-flow: **???**
decrement-event: **phase**
outflow: **???**
inflow: **???**
transfer: **event**
take: **???**
duality: **relator**
transfer-duality: **relator**
produce: **???**
outside-party: **role**
consume: **???**
from: **???**

3 - Provide the explanation for each stereotype inferred:
transformation-duality: Represents the relationship between a transformation event and its dual.
trading-partner: Represents the role of an economic agent involved in trading.
give: Since there is no description of this element, it is impossible to infer a possible OntoUML stereotype.
to: Since there is no description of this element, it is impossible to infer a possible OntoUML stereotype.
economic-event: Represents an event related to economic activities.
participation: Since there is no description of this element, it is impossible to infer a possible OntoUML stereotype.
increment-event: Represents a phase in which there is an increment of some kind.
inside-party: Represents a role of a party that's internal to an economic event.
transformation: Represents an event of transforming economic resources.
economic-agent: Represents a fundamental kind of entity that engages in economic activities.
economic-resource: Represents a fundamental kind of entity that is used or consumed in economic activities.
stock-flow: Since there is no description of this element, it is impossible to infer a possible OntoUML stereotype.
decrement-event: Represents a phase in which there is a decrement of some kind.
outflow: Since there is no description of this element, it is impossible to infer a possible OntoUML stereotype.
inflow: Since there is no description of this element, it is impossible to infer a possible OntoUML stereotype.
transfer: Represents an event of transferring economic resources.
take: Since there is no description of this element, it is impossible to infer a possible OntoUML stereotype.
duality: Represents a generic dual relationship between two elements.
transfer-duality: Represents the dual relationship in a transfer event.
produce: Since there is no description of this element, it is impossible to infer a possible OntoUML stereotype.
outside-party: Represents a role of a party external to an economic event.
consume: Since there is no description of this element, it is impossible to infer a possible OntoUML stereotype.
from: Since there is no description of this element, it is impossible to infer a possible OntoUML stereotype.
