3 - Providing explanation for each stereotype:
    - **Capability-requiring Role:** Represents a role that requires certain capabilities. As it can be applied to different types of agents, it's a mixin, and since its instantiation depends on contingent, external factors, it's a roleMixin.
    - **Physical Agent:** A more specific type of agent that has physical properties.
    - **Capability Context:** Represents a category that encompasses the properties and characteristics related to a capability's context.
    - **Competence Context:**  Represents a category that encompasses the properties and characteristics related to a competence's context.
    - **Personal Competence:** A specific type of competence possessed by an individual.
    - **Artifact Type:** Represents a fundamental kind of artifact, defining the characteristics shared by all its instances.
    - **Social Capability:**  A specific type of capability that is related to social interactions and contexts.
    - **Human Aspect:** A specific aspect related to humans.
    - **Capability:** Represents a fundamental kind of ability or capacity.
    - **Task:** Represents a fundamental kind of activity or piece of work to be done.
    - **Social Agent:** A more specific type of agent that can interact in social contexts.
    - **Attitude:**  Represents a specific type of mental state or disposition.
    - **Person:** Represents a fundamental kind, denoting human beings.
    - **Human Aspect Type:** Represents a fundamental kind of human aspect, defining the characteristics shared by all its instances.
    - **Human Characteristic:**  Represents a fundamental kind of characteristic or trait associated with humans.
    - **Task Type:**  Represents a fundamental kind of task, defining the characteristics shared by all its instances.
    - **Competence Type:** Represents a fundamental kind of competence, defining the characteristics shared by all its instances.
    - **Skill:**  Represents a specific, learned competence.
    - **Human Aspect Phase:** Represents a phase in the life cycle of a human aspect, characterized by intrinsic, contingent conditions.
    - **Knowledge:** Represents a specific type of information or understanding.
    - **Agent:** Represents a fundamental kind, denoting entities capable of acting or exerting influence.
    - **Capability Outcome:** Represents a fundamental kind of result or consequence of using a capability.
    - **Human Capability:** A specific type of capability possessed by humans.
    - **Object:** Represents a fundamental kind, denoting entities in the most general sense.
    - **Disposition:** Represents a specific type of inclination or tendency.
    - **Capability Manifestation:** Represents a fundamental kind, denoting the observable expression or demonstration of a capability.
    - **Competence Outcome:**  Represents a fundamental kind of result or consequence of using a competence.
    - **Skill Type:**  Represents a fundamental kind of skill, defining the characteristics shared by all its instances.
    - **Artifact:** Represents a fundamental kind, denoting objects made by human beings, typically for a particular purpose.
