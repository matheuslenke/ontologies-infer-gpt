3 - Provide the explanation for each stereotype inferred:
    Story: A fundamental sort of endurant type. For example, the types person, dog, computer, car, organization and marriage are typically considered to be kinds.
    Role: Anti-rigid types that define contingent properties for their instances. Their instantiation is characterized by extrinsic contingent conditions. For example, the role Student of the kind Person.
    Requirements: Rigid types that define essential properties for their instances, e.g., the category 'physical object' describing the properties of having a mass and a spatial extension, common to things of the kinds car, person, bridge, cow, etc.
    Attributes: Rigid types that define essential properties for their instances, e.g., the category 'physical object' describing the properties of having a mass and a spatial extension, common to things of the kinds car, person, bridge, cow, etc.
    Experience Levels: An instance of a class stereotyped quality is a particularized property that can be understood as a value in a conceptual space, for example, the weight or height of a person which can be measured in centimeters, or the color of an eye that can be represented in an RGB tuple.
    Membership: An instance of a class stereotyped relator is a truth-makers of a material relation, an entity that needs to exist for two or more related individuals to be connected through a material relation. For example, a handshake depends on two individuals of the kind element Person. Examples or relators include social objects such as Marriage, or a purchase order from an online store.
