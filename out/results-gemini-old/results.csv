Instance Variable;mode;An instance variable represents a specific attribute or characteristic of an instance of a class. It holds a particular value that can vary from instance to instance. This concept aligns well with the notion of 'mode' in OntoUML, which represents a particularized property that is not conceived as a value in a conceptual space. For instance, the color of a car (an instance of the class Car) would be an instance variable, and 'color' itself, as a property that can have different values like 'red,' 'blue,' or 'green,' would be considered a 'mode.'
Class;kind;In object-oriented programming, a 'class' is a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of the class. It defines a set of attributes and methods that characterize the objects created from it.  This closely resembles the concept of 'kind' in OntoUML, which represents a fundamental sort of entity type.  For example, a 'Car' class would be a 'kind' as it defines the blueprint for creating individual car objects, each with its own specific properties like color, model, and make.
Subclass;subkind;A 'subclass' is a specialized version of a 'class' that inherits properties and methods from its parent class while potentially adding its own unique characteristics. This aligns with the 'subkind' stereotype in OntoUML. For instance, if 'Car' is a 'kind,' then 'ElectricCar' could be a 'subkind' as it inherits the general properties of a car but adds specific features related to being electric, like battery capacity.
Table;kind;In the context of databases, a 'table' represents a collection of related data organized in rows and columns.  Each row in a table corresponds to a unique record, and each column represents a specific attribute. Given its role as a fundamental building block for storing and organizing data, 'table' can be considered a 'kind' in OntoUML. For example, a 'Customers' table in a database would be a 'kind' as it represents the concept of customers and their associated information.
Variable Mapping;relator;'Variable Mapping' suggests a connection or correspondence between variables. This aligns with the 'relator' stereotype, which represents an entity that establishes a relationship between two or more other entities. In this context, 'Variable Mapping' acts as the 'relator' that links or maps variables to each other. For instance, in a programming scenario, a variable representing a customer's name in one part of the code might be mapped to a variable representing the same customer's name in a different part of the code, and this mapping relationship is what 'Variable Mapping' represents.
Entity Table;kind;An 'Entity Table' in database design typically represents a table that stores information about a specific entity or concept within the system being modeled. Since it serves as a fundamental structure for representing a distinct entity type, it aligns with the concept of 'kind' in OntoUML. For instance, in a database for an e-commerce platform, a 'Products' entity table would be considered a 'kind' as it represents the concept of 'products' and their associated attributes.
Table per Concrete Class Inheritance Mapping;relator;'Table per Concrete Class Inheritance Mapping' points towards a specific database inheritance mapping strategy. This strategy is about establishing a relationship between concrete classes and database tables.

Single Entity Table;kind;As the name suggests, a 'Single Entity Table' is designed to store information about a single type of entity. This aligns well with the 'kind' stereotype as it represents a fundamental entity type in the system. For example, a 'Customers' table intended to store data exclusively about customers would be a 'Single Entity Table.'
Many To One Relationship Mapping;relator;'Many To One Relationship Mapping' refers to a way of representing relationships between entities where multiple instances of one entity can be associated with a single instance of another entity. This mapping itself acts as the connector between these entities, hence categorized as a 'relator' in OntoUML.

Relationship Association Table;relator;A 'Relationship Association Table' is typically used in database design to represent a many-to-many relationship between entities. It acts as an intermediary table connecting these entities, making it suitable to be categorized as a 'relator' in OntoUML.
One To One Relationship Mapping;relator;Similar to other relationship mappings, 'One To One Relationship Mapping' denotes a way to represent a one-to-one relationship between entities.  It signifies that one instance of an entity is associated with only one instance of another entity. As it establishes a connection between entities, it falls under the 'relator' stereotype.

Column;mode;In the context of databases, a 'Column' represents a specific attribute or characteristic of the entities stored in a table. It defines what type of data can be stored in that column.  Given that it represents a particularized property, it aligns with the 'mode' stereotype in OntoUML.
Mapped Primary Key;mode;A 'Mapped Primary Key' likely refers to a primary key column that has been mapped to another entity or element. This mapping is a specific characteristic of the primary key itself, making it suitable to be categorized as a 'mode' in OntoUML.
Primary Key Mapping;relator;'Primary Key Mapping' suggests a connection or association established between a primary key and another element. This connection is central to database relationships, making 'Primary Key Mapping' a 'relator' in OntoUML.
Nullability;mode;In database design, 'Nullability' is an attribute of a column that determines whether it can contain NULL values or not. It's a characteristic of the column itself, making it suitable to be categorized as a 'mode' in OntoUML.
Class Mapping;relator;'Class Mapping' broadly refers to the process of creating a correspondence between classes and other elements. Given its role in connecting classes to other elements, 'Class Mapping' can be classified as a 'relator' in OntoUML.
Foreign Key Mapping;relator;Similar to 'Primary Key Mapping,' 'Foreign Key Mapping' denotes the connection established between a foreign key column and a primary key column in another table. This relationship is fundamental to database integrity, hence classifying 'Foreign Key Mapping' as a 'relator' in OntoUML.
Foreign Key Column;mode;A 'Foreign Key Column' is a column that creates a link between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table. It represents a specific attribute of a table and how it relates to another table, making it a 'mode' in OntoUML.
Table per Class Inheritance Mapping;relator;'Table per Class Inheritance Mapping' indicates a strategy for mapping inheritance relationships to a database, where each class in the hierarchy has a corresponding table. As it establishes connections between classes and tables based on inheritance, it acts as a 'relator.'
Extendable Class;kind;An 'Extendable Class' likely refers to a class that can be extended or subclassed. Given its role as a blueprint that can be further specialized, it fits the description of a 'kind' in OntoUML.
Entity Subclass;subkind;An 'Entity Subclass' represents a subclass that inherits characteristics from its entity superclass. It specializes the concept represented by its superclass, aligning with the 'subkind' stereotype in OntoUML.
Inheritance;formal;'Inheritance,' in the context of object-oriented programming, describes a relationship where a subclass inherits properties and behaviors from its superclass.  This is a fundamental concept that defines the structure and organization of classes.  In OntoUML, 'formal' relations are used to represent such structuring mechanisms that determine how other relations in the model are to be interpreted. Therefore, 'Inheritance' can be considered a 'formal' relation.
