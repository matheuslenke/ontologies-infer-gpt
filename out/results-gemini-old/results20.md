{
"name": "FunctionalConcern",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "It is a specific type of Concern, representing concerns related to the functions of a system. As it specializes a more general concept, 'subkind' seems appropriate."
},
{
"name": "Keyword",
"inferred_stereotype": "kind",
"explanation": "Keywords are distinct entities used for indexing or classification. They exist independently, making 'kind' a suitable stereotype."
},
{
"name": "Relationship",
"inferred_stereotype": "relator",
"explanation": "Relationships connect entities, and 'relator' represents entities that act as truth-makers for material relations, making it fitting for connecting other elements in the domain."

{
"name": "ContributionType",
"inferred_stereotype": "kind",
"explanation": "Contribution types categorize different ways entities can contribute. It represents a distinct concept, hence 'kind'."
},
{
"name": "Concern",
"inferred_stereotype": "kind",
"explanation": "Concern represents a core concept in this domain, likely with its own properties and relationships. Being a fundamental, independent entity, 'kind' fits."
},
{
"name": "Dependency",
"inferred_stereotype": "relator",
"explanation": "Dependency signifies a relation between entities where one relies on another. 'Relator' is apt as it represents entities establishing such connections."
},
{
"name": "Contribution",
"inferred_stereotype": "relator",
"explanation": "Contribution implies a connection between entities, with one contributing to another. 'Relator' accurately depicts this as it connects elements based on this relation."
},
{
"name": "Source",
"inferred_stereotype": "kind",
"explanation": "Source seems to represent the origin of something, which can be an independent entity. Therefore, 'kind' is a reasonable choice."
},
{
"name": "SourceType",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "As it suggests a specialization of 'Source', indicating different types of sources, 'subkind' is a suitable stereotype."
},
{
"name": "Composition",
"inferred_stereotype": "relator",
"explanation": "Composition suggests a whole-part relationship, indicating one entity being composed of others. 'Relator' is fitting as it represents entities establishing this type of connection."
},
{
"name": "NonFunctionalConcern",
"inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
"explanation": "Similar to 'FunctionalConcern', it specializes 'Concern', focusing on non-functional aspects. Thus, 'subkind' appropriately reflects its nature."
