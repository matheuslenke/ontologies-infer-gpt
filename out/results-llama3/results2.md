Here is the JSON array with the inferred stereotypes and explanations:

[
  {
    "name": "Foreign Key Mapping",
    "inferred_stereotype": "category",
    "explanation": "Foreign key mapping is a type of relationship that involves referencing the primary key of another entity, which fits into the category of fundamental endurant types."
  },
  {
    "name": "Instance Variable",
    "inferred_stereotype": "quality",
    "explanation": "Instance variable refers to a particularized property or attribute of an object, which is an instance of a quality - a type of non-sortal in the UFO ontology."
  },
  {
    "name": "Mapped Primary Key",
    "inferred_stereotype": "relator",
    "explanation": "A mapped primary key refers to a truth-maker of a material relation, which fits into the relator category - a type of sortal in the UFO ontology."
  },
  {
    "name": "Inheritance",
    "inferred_stereotype": "phase",
    "explanation": "Inheritance is a concept that involves contingent intrinsic classification conditions for an entity, which fits into the phase category - a type of sortal in the UFO ontology."
  },
  {
    "name": "Variable Mapping",
    "inferred_stereotype": "mixin",
    "explanation": "Variable mapping refers to semi-rigid properties essential to some instances and accidental to others, which fits into the mixin category - an anti-rigid type defining contingent properties for its instances."
  },
  {
    "name": "Entity Superclass",
    "inferred_stereotype": "kind",
    "explanation": "Entity superclass refers to a fundamental endurant type with uniform principles of individuation, identity, and persistence for its instances, which fits into the kind category - a type of sortal in the UFO ontology."
  },
  {
    "name": "Table per Class Inheritance Mapping",
    "inferred_stereotype": "category",
    "explanation": "This type of mapping refers to rigid types defining essential properties for their instances, which fits into the category category - an anti-rigid type defining contingent properties for its instances."
  },
  {
    "name": "Class Mapping",
    "inferred_stereotype": "quality",
    "explanation": "Class mapping refers to a particularized property or attribute of an object, which is an instance of a quality - a type of non-sortal in the UFO ontology."
  },
  {
    "name": "Table per Concrete Class Inheritance Mapping",
    "inferred_stereotype": "category",
    "explanation": "This type of mapping refers to rigid types defining essential properties for their instances, which fits into the category category - an anti-rigid type defining contingent properties for its instances."
  },
  {
    "name": "Spuerclass",
    "inferred_stereotype": "kind",
    "explanation": "Superclass refers to a fundamental endurant type with uniform principles of individuation, identity, and persistence for its instances, which fits into the kind category - a type of sortal in the UFO ontology."
  },
  {
    "name": "Class",
    "inferred_stereotype": "kind",
    "explanation": "This refers to a fundamental endurant type with uniform principles of individuation, identity, and persistence for its instances, which fits into the kind category - a type of sortal in the UFO ontology."
  },
  {
    "name": "Primary Key Column",
    "inferred_stereotype": "relator",
    "explanation": "Primary key column refers to a truth-maker of a material relation, which fits into the relator category - a type of sortal in the UFO ontology."
  },
  {
    "name": "Relationship Mapping",
    "inferred_stereotype": "category",
    "explanation": "This refers to rigid types defining essential properties for their instances, which fits into the category category - an anti-rigid type defining contingent properties for its instances."
  },
  {
    "name": "Subclass",
    "inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
    "explanation": "Subclass refers to a rigid specialization of a kind, which fits into the subkind category - a type of sortal in the UFO ontology."
  },
  {
    "name": "Entity Subclass",
    "inferred_stereotype": "subkind",
    "explanation": "This refers to a rigid specialization of an entity's kind, which fits into the subkind category - a type of sortal in the UFO ontology."
  },
  {
    "name": "Mapped Foreign Key",
    "inferred_stereotype": "relator",
    "explanation": "Mapped foreign key refers to a truth-maker of a material relation, which fits into the relator category - a type of sortal in the UFO ontology."
  },
  {
    "name": "One",
    "inferred_stereotype": "kind",
    "explanation": "This is not specified as an actual term, but if it referred to a specific entity or concept, it would fit into the kind category - a type of sortal in the UFO ontology."
  }
